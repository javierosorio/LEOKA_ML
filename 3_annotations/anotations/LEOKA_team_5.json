just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm. His criminal history included arrests for assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest, a weapons violation, and a drug law violation.

lieutenant with the Chattahoochee Hills Police Department (CHPD) was shot to death in an unprovoked attack. The lieutenant, a 30-year veteran of law enforcement, was on patrol in the city. Around noon, a county dispatcher received a telephone call from a passerby who had come upon the lieutenant’s patrol vehicle and discovered the lieutenant inside. Responding units arrived at the scene and found the patrol car still running and the back window shattered. Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon. A caller indicated that the suspect was in the area where the lieutenant had been shot and that the weapon used in the slaying had originally been purchased as a non-automatic weapon but had been altered by the alleged shooter to be “fully automatic.” When the tipster spoke with the ATF agent, the individual indicated that the alleged shooter had said that when he shot the lieutenant, the weapon was on “full auto.” On February 17, a 44-year-old man was arrested for the shooting and charged with Murder, Aggravated Assault, and Possession of a Firearm. The man, who was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record that included violent crime and weapons violations. He also was acquainted with the victim lieutenant through a law enforcement relationship.", "id.num": 832}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.760480Z", "updated_at":

with the Nash County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed during a tactical situation while attempting to serve First-Degree Murder warrants in Kinston. The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor. Four suspects, aged 26-, 18-, 17-, and 16-years-old, were subsequently arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The 18-year-old was also charged with a second count of First-Degree Murder. Each suspect, with the exception of the 16-year-old, had prior arrests.", "id.num": 1066}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.760513Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T19:55:39.024491Z",

After leaving the store, he was confronted in the parking lot by two men who had allegedly watched him enter the store and viewed him as a profitable robbery mark. The two men approached the agent, and one of them pointed a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at him as the other patted him down for weapons. The agent identified himself as a police officer, and the perpetrators discovered the agent’s service weapon. The man holding the handgun shot the agent twice at close range, striking him once in the abdomen, before the two subjects fled the scene. The agent was taken to a local hospital where he died from his wounds seven days later. Investigators apprehended the perpetrators on November 9. The 26-year-old offender who had fired the gun was charged with First-Degree Intentional Homicide, Attempted Robbery, and Possession of a Firearm by a Felon. A known drug dealer, he had a criminal record that included convictions for violent crimes, drugs, and weapons violations.

The police officer, who had nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, was assisting the probation official at the residence of a probationer who allegedly wanted to turn in a firearm. The subject, the probation officer, and the police officer were conversing in front of the apartment complex when the subject produced a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and began shooting the police officer. The victim officer was wounded in the upper and lower torso/back despite his body armor, in the arms/hands, and in the rear of the head. After mortally wounding the officer, the subject stole the officer’s service weapon and fled the scene in the officer’s police cruiser. Responding officers caught up with the subject when he crashed the cruiser less than a mile away from the shooting. The 20-year-old subject exited the vehicle to flee on foot but was confronted by the officers. He pointed the firearm at officers who responded with gunfire. The subject was critically wounded in the head and taken to a nearby hospital. The victim officer was also transported to the hospital where he died from the rear head wound in the early morning hours of October 29.", "id.num": 650}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head. Due to the continuing threat to first responders, it was nearly an hour before a medic could safely assess the victim lieutenant’s condition. After the threat area was secured, the victim lieutenant was transported to a medical examiner’s office where he was pronounced dead.

park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia. The suspect had a prior criminal record and was found to be under the influence of alcohol and narcotics at the time of the incident. Just before 1 a.m. on February 23, a 44-year-old trooper with the Washington State Patrol, Bremerton, requested information on a vehicle during a traffic stop in Gorst. When dispatchers could not make further contact with the trooper, a deputy sheriff was sent to investigate and found the veteran trooper, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience and who was wearing body armor, along the roadside with a single gunshot wound to the front of his head from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The victim trooper was transported to a nearby hospital and confirmed dead. About four hours after the shooting, the vehicle in question was found abandoned a few miles from the scene. Investigators learned the owner of the abandoned vehicle had obtained a ride to a friend’s property in a nearby town. As a SWAT team surrounded the friend’s property a gunshot was heard coming from a trailer. A female exited the trailer and told the SWAT team the 28-year-old suspect had shot himself. The female also indicated the suspect had said he shot “a cop.” The suspect was taken to a nearby hospital and later died of his self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was a known drug dealer with a prior criminal record, which included drug violations, violent crime, and police assault. The suspect was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.", "id.num": 526}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.760649Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T19:54:35.377718Z",

County Sheriff’s Office (PCSO) was killed, and a 59-year-old deputy sheriff with the PCSO was wounded in Council Bluffs while transporting prisoners at 10:55 a.m. on May 1. The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail. The male prisoner exited the back of the van and immediately began assaulting the 43-year-old deputy, a 16-year law enforcement veteran, with a homemade cutting instrument, cutting the deputy’s head, neck, arms/hands, and front legs/feet. With the deputy down, the suspect ran to the driver’s seat of the van. The injured deputy, who was wearing body armor, recovered and entered the van through the front passenger’s side door. The 59-year-old deputy, who was also wearing body armor, ran to the driver’s side of the van to attempt to apprehend the suspect. During the struggle, the suspect gained possession of one of the deputy’s service weapons, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The suspect fatally shot the injured 43-year-old deputy in the side of the head with the service weapon. The suspect then shot the 59-year-old deputy in the front lower torso/abdomen below his protective vest and took possession of the other deputy’s service weapon. The injured 59-year-old deputy fell to the ground outside the van. The suspect exited the van and took the van keys and extra ammunition from the 59-year-old deputy. The suspect got back in the van, started it with the stolen keys, and fled the scene by ramming the closed sally port door. At 10:57 a.m., the suspect pulled up behind two motorists in a pickup truck at an intersection. The truck driver noticed the suspect exiting the van dressed in a yellow jumpsuit carrying a firearm and realized the man was an escaped prisoner. As the suspect attempted to open the driver’s side door of the truck, the truck driver tried to drive away, but the suspect fired one round through the truck’s window, striking the driver in the neck. The injured motorist continued driving until he drove into a ditch north of the intersection. The suspect returned to the van and fled. A few minutes later, the suspect drove up behind another vehicle stopped at a stop sign. The suspect drove past the vehicle and parked in front of it in the middle of an intersection. The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody. He had a criminal history that included murder charges. The deputies were transported to a local hospital where the 43-year-old deputy was pronounced dead. The 59-year-old deputy was treated for severe injuries. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured deputy had not returned to duty.", "id.num": 40}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.760717Z", "updated_at":

patrol deputy with the Reagan County Sheriff’s Office was fatally wounded as he responded to an alley to investigate a suspicious person at 6:20 p.m. on August 1. The off-duty deputy, who had more than 5 years of law enforcement experience, found a man seated in the backyard of a residence in Big Lake. The veteran deputy parked his patrol vehicle and, as he walked in front of the vehicle towards the man, the man fired one round from a .223-caliber bolt-action rifle from a distance of more than 50 feet. The round struck the deputy in the rear lower torso/back. The injured deputy ran east from the scene while calling for backup on his portable radio. Witnesses saw the 42-year-old offender follow the deputy for a short distance before returning to the residence. The deputy was able to tell emergency medical personnel and responding officers the offender’s name before he succumbed to his wound. The officers entered the offender’s residence, but exited when the offender began firing his weapon. The offender remained barricaded in the residence until late the next morning when he surrendered to SWAT officers after an unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide. The offender, who was a known drug user and had a prior criminal record including police assault, violent crime, and weapons violations, died six days later from his self-inflicted injury.", "id.num":

Patrol died on February 9 as a result of injuries suffered in a shooting on April 25, 1999. Around 7:30 in the evening of the incident, the trooper, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a report of a woman’s body found in a local cemetery. The trooper, along with other troopers and the sheriff and deputies from the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department, arrived at the cemetery and found the body with a fatal gunshot wound to the head. As the officers were securing the scene, a man approached them. When questioned, he identified himself as the dead woman’s husband and told officers he had shot her and was going to kill himself as well. At that time, officers observed that the 52-year-old suspect was hiding a .357 Magnum revolver behind his back and took cover. The suspect raised the gun but did not threaten the officers. The trooper and the sheriff began to negotiate with the suspect in an attempt to talk him into putting down his weapon. During the discussion, the trooper made an attempt to disarm the man by throwing a flashlight against his chest. The trooper and the sheriff then rushed the man, and as he fell backwards, the man fired three times hitting the sheriff in the shoulder and striking the trooper in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fatally shot himself in the head. Emergency medical technicians immediately responded to the scene and treated both the trooper and the sheriff. The victim trooper, who suffered severe blood loss and spinal cord injury from his neck wound, was transported to an area hospital and later admitted to a trauma center where he spent 8 months. The trooper’s injuries resulted in his paralysis from the neck down and ultimately led to his death nearly 7 years after the incident.", "id.num": 412}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

restrain and control a suspect during an investigative activity shortly before 4 p.m. on February 5 in Colorado Springs. The deputy, an 11-year veteran of law enforcement, was part of a multiagency motor vehicle theft task force. Earlier that afternoon, the task force was notified of a stolen vehicle that had been spotted in several areas throughout El Paso County. Task force members found the vehicle at an apartment complex, even though the suspect stopped at several locations and spray painted it in an attempt to disguise it. Members of the task force identified the suspect alone in the parking lot. The 34-year-old deputy and a 29-year-old deputy approached the suspect as he walked to the stolen vehicle. The two deputies grabbed the suspect and attempted to take him into custody. The suspect pulled out a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shot the 29-year-old deputy once in the front lower torso/abdomen below his body armor. The suspect wrestled with the 34-year-old deputy and continued firing his weapon, fatally striking him in the rear upper torso/back and the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. A 45-year-old sergeant with the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office and a 44-year-old detective with the Colorado Springs Police Department, both members of the task force and also wearing body armor, exchanged gunfire with the suspect. Both the sergeant and detective were injured. Despite his injuries, the detective returned gunfire striking the 19-year-old suspect in the front upper torso/chest, justifiably killing him. The suspect had previous arrests for a drug law violation and theft and was a known or suspected gang member. The sergeant, a 16-year veteran of law enforcement, recovered from minor injuries to his rear below the waist/buttocks and rear legs and has returned to duty. The 29-year-old deputy, an 8-year veteran of law enforcement, suffered severe wounds to the front lower torso/abdomen. The detective, a 21-year veteran of law enforcement, sustained severe injuries to the front below waist/groin area. Neither the 29-year-old deputy nor the detective has returned to duty. A bystander was also struck and paralyzed by a round fired by the suspect.", "id.num": 26}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.760846Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T20:17:29.085807Z",

officer, who had 24 years of law enforcement experience, was working an overtime detail when he observed a vehicle being driven in a reckless manner. The officer followed the vehicle to a residential area, but the driver eluded him. While attempting to locate the vehicle, the officer received  a radio assignment to assist another officer with a person suspected of driving under the influence. As the officer was turning around, he saw the vehicle he had been pursuing now parked in the middle of the street. The officer activated his emergency lights, pulled behind the suspect vehicle, and noticed the driver's side door was slightly ajar. The officer did not have time to notify dispatch of his location before the offender left his vehicle and advanced on the officer while firing multiple rounds from his 9 mm semiautomatic firearm. Five rounds struck the officer as he was exiting his patrol vehicle. Two of the rounds struck him in the legs, and one round hit him in the center of his body but was stopped by his protective vest; the last two rounds hit him in the feet. The officer drew his service weapon and returned fire, causing the offender to retreat to his vehicle. None of the officer's rounds struck the offender. Accompanied by four other people, the offender fled in his vehicle. He drove to another state and turned himself in the same day. The 25-year-old offender was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The officer recovered from his injuries and returned to full duty.", "id.num": 1234}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.760877Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T20:18:05.357064Z", "inner_id":

suspicious persons or circumstances.

The second officer had responded as backup when he heard the call from dispatch. The investigating officer had subdued one of the suspects and was attempting to search him as she instructed the second suspect to place his hands on the hood of the vehicle. The assisting officer had entered his patrol car and was calling dispatch with the suspects’ vehicle information. The second suspect, who was apparently armed with a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun, shot the investigating officer fatally in her neck/throat and then ran to the assisting officer’s vehicle and shot multiple rounds into the car. The assisting officer, who was wearing body armor, was wounded in his rear lower torso/back and his leg. The investigating officer, who was also wearing body armor at the time of the shooting, was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead later that day. The 28-year-old assisting officer underwent surgery and was expected to make a full recovery. The alleged shooter, a 21-year-old man with a prior criminal record and who was on probation at the time of the incident, fled the scene. He was located the next day in Birmingham at a friend’s residence and was arrested without incident by officers from a multiagency task force.

Comal County Sheriff’s Office was shot while handling a person with a mental illness in Bulverde. The deputy, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a residence where a man reportedly had a firearm and was suicidal. The caller was a family member and said he believed the man intended to attempt “suicide by cop.” When the 35-year-old deputy, along with three officers from the Bulverde Police Department (BPD), pulled up to the residence, they saw a man walking around with a firearm in his hand. The deputy and officers drew their weapons and ordered the man several times to put down the weapon, telling him they were there to help. The man walked into the street in front of the deputy’s patrol unit and began to walk toward the vehicle with the firearm in his hands. He then raised his arms and fired the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the officers. The deputy returned fire with his rifle. One round from the assailant’s weapon struck the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the front lower torso/stomach below his body armor. The victim deputy took cover at the back of his patrol unit, and he and responding BPD officers continued to return fire, striking the suspect several times. The victim deputy was taken by ambulance, then by helicopter, to a hospital for treatment. The deputy recovered from his injuries and has since returned to duty. The 22-year-old suspect, who also was taken to a hospital, was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer. Just before 7 p.m. on January 2, a 49-year-old sergeant with the Denton Police Department was assaulted while handling a person with a mental illness. The 20-year veteran sergeant was one of three officers who were dispatched to a local hotel to deal with a 911 caller who was incoherent and agitated, using methamphetamine, and armed with a knife which had a blade approximately 3 to 4 inches long. The caller repeatedly told dispatchers he had “committed crimes and hurt people.” The officers, who obtained a room key from management, spent some time speaking with the subject and trying to get him to open the door. A fourth officer, who was certified to use an electronic control weapon (ECW) arrived on the scene. When all attempts to get the man to come out of the room failed, the officers prepared to use the master key and a two-prong fork tool to disable the swing arm deadbolt lock. The door was unlocked, and the sergeant, who was wearing body armor, was operating the two-prong fork tool on the deadbolt when the subject thrust the knife through the narrow opening, striking the sergeant in the arms/hands. The fourth officer deployed the ECW on the suspect’s hand, and though only one prong hit, it was enough to cause the suspect to drop the knife. The officers forced the door open, and a second burst from the ECW made contact with the suspect’s chest. Officers were able to subdue and handcuff him. The 38-year-old suspect was taken to the city jail where he was placed in a restraint chair and incarcerated. The suspect, who had no reported prior criminal history, said he had been doing methamphetamine since the day before. The injured sergeant returned to duty after this incident.", "id.num": 663}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.760981Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T20:43:01.819728Z", "inner_id": 18,

the Oklahoma Highway Patrol was shot and killed with his service weapon shortly before 7 a.m. on December 26 while investigating a suspicious person in Devol. A newspaper delivery person notified the 35-year-old officer at his residence of an unconscious individual in a vehicle on a rural road. The officer, with nearly 7 years of law enforcement experience, was not scheduled to go on duty until later in the day, but he donned his uniform and went to investigate the matter. At 6:42 a.m., the trooper radioed dispatchers that he was investigating a vehicle with a male inside and that he could not see the vehicle’s registration tag. As the trooper approached the vehicle, he saw chemicals commonly used to produce drugs. When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.", "id.num": 580}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect.

Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.", "id.num": 290}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

19 while attempting to make a traffic stop. Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was treated at a nearby hospital, but died from the wound to his upper back from a round that entered through the armhole of his vest. The offender was also treated for his injuries and later charged with Aggravated Murder, Having a Weapon While Under Disability, and Carrying a Concealed Weapon. The offender was known to police and had a prior criminal history including violent crime, murder, drug violations, police assault, and weapons violations. The night of the shooting, the offender was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and the arresting officers found a bag of marijuana in his possession.", "id.num": 277}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence. After a standoff of several hours, SWAT officers arrested the alleged shooter without further incident. He was charged with Murder.", "id.num": 196}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761173Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T20:52:14.409516Z", "inner_id": 24, "total_annotations": 3,

As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest. The deputy was able to fire four rounds from his service weapon, but none of the rounds struck the suspect. Another officer then shot the suspect in the head, killing him instantly.

"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.", "id.num": 721}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761303Z", "updated_at":

Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The suspect was subsequently found unconscious in his jail cell and later died. The cause of death had not been determined at the time of this report.", "id.num": 624}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761332Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T21:01:14.668843Z",

after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31. The deceased offender was later found to have marijuana and cocaine in a bag tied to his belt and concealed in his clothes. Friends of the suspect reported he had told them he did not want to go back to prison and would “do what he had to do to stay out.” The suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, police assault, weapons violations, and drug violations, had been convicted previously. The suspect was also a registered sex offender.", "id.num": 547}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761370Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T21:03:04.537736Z", "inner_id": 30,

around 8 a.m. on February 20. The veteran officer, who had 27 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene and parked his marked patrol unit behind one of the vehicles involved in the crash. A 27-year-old backup officer arrived and parked his marked patrol unit in front of the same vehicle. The veteran officer approached the driver, who was in the driver’s seat of the vehicle. The backup officer positioned himself at the vehicle’s front passenger-side door. As the veteran officer returned to the passenger’s side of his patrol unit to retrieve equipment, the backup officer moved to the back of the crashed vehicle to run its license plate number. Dispatch alerted them that the vehicle was stolen, so both officers approached the driver’s side door of the crashed vehicle. The veteran officer asked the driver to step out of the vehicle and face away from him. The driver initially complied, and the officer asked him to place his hands behind his back. Suddenly, the driver retrieved a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from his right rear pants pocket and fired two rounds at the backup officer, who was wearing body armor. One of the rounds struck the backup officer in the front lower torso/abdomen; however, his body armor prevented the round from entering his body. The second round struck and damaged the backup officer’s holstered service weapon as he turned around to seek cover behind his patrol unit. The suspect turned and fired three rounds at the veteran officer. The rounds struck the officer in his arms/hands and fatally in the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. Then, the suspect continued to shoot at the backup officer, who returned fire with one round before his damaged service weapon became inoperable. The suspect moved toward the rear passenger door of the victim officer’s patrol unit. Another officer, who had responded to the other vehicle in the crash, heard the gunfire and ran to the scene. The officer saw the suspect crouched beside the victim officer’s patrol unit holding a handgun and the victim officer on the ground, not moving. The officer fired his service weapon at the suspect, striking him once. After the suspect was hit, he threw his firearm down and surrendered. The mortally wounded officer was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The backup officer was transported to a local hospital where he was treated and released. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured backup officer had not returned to duty. The 26-year-old suspect, who was on parole at the time of the incident, was arrested and charged with Murder of a Police Officer. He had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime and a drug law violation.", "id.num": 52}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761403Z", "updated_at":

police officer with the San Diego Police Department was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack around 5:30 p.m. on August 6. In an area of San Diego County, a man pulled into a drive-in restaurant and fired a shotgun at close range, nonfatally wounding a man who was sitting in a vehicle. The wounded man and the suspect did not know each other. Sheriff’s deputies responded to the area and located the suspect’s vehicle. A short car chase ensued, but because it reached a high rate of speed, the chase was called off. Officials notified neighboring jurisdictions of the incident and provided a description of the vehicle. A few minutes later, the officer, who had just left a local restaurant, pulled up to a stop sign in a commercial area. The suspect pulled his vehicle alongside, and the driver fired two rounds from the 12-gauge shotgun out the passenger window into the officer’s vehicle. The rounds struck the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. Witnesses came to the officer’s aid and radioed for help. However, the officer, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience, died at a local hospital the next day. After fleeing the scene, the suspect went to his apartment. When he left his apartment to return to his vehicle, he was met by law enforcement officers. As he raised his shotgun to point at the officers, they shot and killed the 23-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record.", "id.num": 346}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.

the Indianapolis Police Department was fatally wounded while responding to a domestic call. Moments earlier, the 41-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience, was the first officer to arrive at the apartment from which a neighbor in the complex had heard cries for help and had contacted the police. The officer knocked on the door, but no one immediately answered. Unknown to the officer, a man inside was holding his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint in the front room and had been doing so for the last 3 hours during which he had physically and sexually assaulted her. The woman’s baby was also in the apartment in a bedroom. Upon hearing the officer knock at the door, the suspect ordered the woman to the floor and looked out the peep hole in the door. As the woman crawled to the hall by a bedroom and began screaming for help, the man moved against the wall behind the front door. At that time, the veteran officer radioed dispatch and other officers that he was going to have to force entry. When the officer forced the door open, the woman began screaming that the man was behind the door. Immediately, the suspect stepped from behind the door and shot the officer at close range with a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The officer fell to the floor in the center of the room and exchanged gunfire with the suspect. The officer fired eight rounds and the offender fired seven rounds, one of which entered the officer’s front upper torso/chest through the armhole of his body armor. A second police officer entered the unit and shot the suspect who fell to the floor in the doorway. Additional officers arrived and tended to the victim officer until he was transported to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to his wound. Gunshots from the second officer justifiably killed the suspect, who was on parole and under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. In addition, the 24-year-old offender was known to use, deal, and possess drugs, and he had a prior criminal record that included weapons violations and drug violations.", "id.num": 629}, "meta": {},

Police in Hanover was shot and fatally wounded on May 26 while investigating suspicious activity in Richmond. The agent, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 18 years of experience, was on patrol with a Richmond City Police Department (RCPD) officer driving through high-crime areas. At 7:20 p.m., they approached a housing development and noticed suspicious activity in a parked vehicle occupied by two individuals. The person in the driver’s seat saw the patrol unit and appeared to stuff something under his thigh or in the center console area. The officer stopped the patrol unit a short distance away from the vehicle, exited, and approached the vehicle on the driver’s side, and the agent approached the passenger’s side. The officer asked the driver to exit the vehicle and walk to the rear of the vehicle on the driver’s side. Once there, the officer patted the driver down. About this time, the agent gave the officer the signal to handcuff the driver, which the officer did. The agent, who was wearing protective body armor, asked the passenger to exit the vehicle, but a struggle ensued as the passenger got out of the vehicle. After securing the driver, the officer attempted to assist the agent. During the struggle, the passenger produced a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol and fired one round, striking the agent in the front of his head. The agent collapsed, and the officer attempted to gain control of the passenger, who had fallen beside the special agent. The passenger eluded the officer and fled on foot. The officer contacted RCPD dispatch to report the wounded agent, and units responded immediately. The following day, the victim agent died from his wound, and the 27-year-old offender was located, arrested, and charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer and Use of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon. The offender had a criminal history that included a violent crime.", "id.num": 43}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761556Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T21:13:08.616728Z", "inner_id":

sheriff with the Clayton County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed while conducting a felony traffic stop in Jonesboro. Earlier in the afternoon, fugitive investigators with the sheriff’s office had located a man for whom they had arrest warrants for Armed Robbery and Aggravated Assault. After seeing the man get into the passenger seat of a vehicle in front of his apartment complex, investigators followed the vehicle out of the complex parking lot in their unmarked vehicle. As the investigators maintained surveillance of the vehicle, they radioed dispatch and requested a marked patrol vehicle to stop it. The 55-year-old deputy, a 12-year veteran of law enforcement, was the first to respond. He positioned his patrol vehicle directly behind the vehicle in which the suspect was riding and initiated a traffic stop. A second deputy, who was also driving a marked patrol vehicle, arrived on the scene to assist. When the first deputy exited his patrol vehicle, he crossed behind the vehicle in which the suspect was riding and approached the passenger-side door. The suspect exited the vehicle and fired at the deputy several times with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, striking the deputy in the left shoulder and in the abdomen below the deputy’s body armor. The shooter then fled the area on foot. The victim deputy was transported by ambulance to a regional medical center where he died that afternoon from the abdominal wound. The 17-year-old shooter, a known drug user with prior mental disorders and a criminal record including drug violations and weapons violations, was located and arrested the same day. He was charged with two counts of Murder, two counts of Aggravated Assault, Armed Robbery, and Possession of a Firearm or Knife During Commission of a Felony.", "id.num": 1138}, "meta": {},

robbery in progress shortly before 7:30 a.m. on April 11. As an employee at a check-cashing business was preparing to open the front door, a man approached, pointed a firearm at her, and ordered her to let him inside. As she opened the door, the employee pushed a portable panic button she was carrying. Once inside the business, the offender forced her to open interior doors, providing the employee an opportunity to enter a distress code into the alarm system. He restrained her with zip ties and told her to open the safe. When she hesitated, the offender sprayed her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. A second offender arrived at the door, and when the first offender had her open the door for him, she grabbed the keys to her vehicle, rushed outside, and tried to enter her vehicle as the two men attacked her. The officer arrived on the scene, and the employee broke free from her attackers and ran toward the officer, who was exiting his patrol unit. The two offenders began firing their weapons, one of which was a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, with many of the 15 rounds striking the officer’s vehicle and shattering the window and windshield. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was injured on the front and side of his head by shards of glass. The officer and the employee moved to the rear of the patrol unit, and the officer returned fire. A round struck one of the offenders in the leg, and he fell to the ground. The other offender tried to pull the wounded offender away, but was unable to do so and fled the scene on foot. Other officers arrived and took the 47-year-old wounded offender into custody. The wounded offender, who had a prior criminal record including charges for a violent crime, was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault on a Public Servant and Aggravated Robbery. The offender who fled discarded his outer clothing, handgun, and a two-way radio nearby. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the second offender had not been captured. The injured officer has returned to duty.", "id.num": 21}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761648Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T21:15:37.808305Z", "inner_id": 39, "total_annotations": 3,

in Virginia City Highlands. The 44-year-old deputy, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, responded to a call of a suicidal subject with a knife. The deputy radioed for backup, parked his patrol unit, and approached the residence on foot because of heavy snow. As the deputy neared the residence, he heard an argument from within the house. When he knocked on the door of the residence and announced himself, the deputy heard a man inside the house making violent threats toward him. The deputy convinced the subject’s wife to exit the house; however, she came outside barefoot and, due to the deep snow, was forced to remain near the house. As he approached the wife, the deputy heard the sound of a bolt being racked in a rifle. Then, from within the house, the subject announced he was going to kill the deputy. Without further warning, the suspect fired 13 rounds at the deputy with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle from a first-floor window. One round struck the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the rear lower torso/back and knocked him to the ground; however, his protective vest prevented a potentially lethal injury. The suspect’s wife, who was standing near the deputy, was struck in the left leg by bullet fragments. The victim deputy regained his footing and fired six rounds from his service weapon into the window where the suspect had been shooting. The deputy then repositioned himself near the rear of the residence. Several minutes later, the suspect, wounded in his right arm and upper torso by flying glass, gave up and exited the house. As the deputy approached, the suspect once again became aggressive, and the deputy used his electronic control weapon twice to immobilize the suspect. The deputy handcuffed the suspect and took him into custody. The 51-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a drug law violation, was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. He was arrested and charged with Attempted Homicide, Battery with a Deadly Weapon Causing Injury, Unlawful Discharge of a Firearm, and Domestic Battery.

County District Attorney’s Office succumbed to injuries he received 11 years earlier.

The suspect had sold methamphetamine to undercover agents on two previous occasions and was presumed to be armed. As agents attempted to breach the door of the residence where the suspect was located, the suspect opened fire from inside the building, shooting through the door and striking the investigator in the front lower torso/abdomen below his body armor. Another OBN agent was also injured. Other agents returned gunfire and justifiably killed the 43-year-old suspect, who had prior arrests including a weapons violation and other crime of violence. The investigator’s resulting spinal cord injury rendered him a paraplegic.

detective with the Battle Creek Police Department was shot and killed while investigating a homicide. The 19-year veteran of law enforcement, along with his partner, was following a lead regarding the murder of a taxicab driver. They were attempting to gain entrance to a second-floor apartment of a female whose name was found along with bloody clothes and a knife inside a gym bag that was located in a garbage bin near the scene of the homicide. When the two detectives did not get an answer at the door, the first detective stepped outside the front of the apartment building and attempted to peer through the window. When he failed to see anything, he returned to the front door of the apartment where the detectives heard movement inside the residence. The second detective stepped outside to the back of the building and observed a male on the screened balcony of the apartment. The second detective identified himself as the police and informed the man he wanted to speak with him. The man turned and went back into the apartment. The second detective was reentering the building when he heard shots. He went down the hallway and looked up the stairs to the apartment door’s landing. A man fired a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun at the second detective and wounded his ankle. The second detective returned fire, but the suspect escaped from the rear balcony of the residence. The wounded detective made his way to his partner, who was lying on the landing in front of the apartment door with gunshot wounds to the arms and hands and the front upper torso and chest. The shotgun was nearby and the detective’s service weapon was missing. The wounded detective performed CPR on his partner; the fallen detective was subsequently taken to an area medical facility where he was pronounced dead. The fleeing suspect allegedly carjacked several vehicles and led Dearborn Police on a high-speed chase before wrecking the stolen car and fleeing on foot. The suspect then forcibly took another vehicle and a brief chase with police culminated in his being apprehended by multiple agencies involved. The 21-year-old suspect, who was on parole, was in possession of the victim detective’s service weapon when he was apprehended. He was charged with Willful Killing of Law Enforcement Officer with Firearm, Aggravated Felonious Assault of Law Enforcement Officer, Felon in Possession of Firearm, and Use of Firearm in Commission

patrol officer with the Twinsburg Police Department was fatally shot while he was attempting to make an arrest. The veteran officer, who had nearly 12½ years of law enforcement experience, made a traffic stop and radioed for a back-up unit. A few minutes later, a resident in the area of the traffic stop called the Twinsburg dispatcher to report hearing individuals arguing and popping sounds. Additional officers arrived at the scene and found the patrol officer lying on the ground near his vehicle, and his K-9 partner was still in the vehicle. The officers pulled the victim patrol officer, who was wearing body armor, across the street to a safer area and attempted to provide medical aid to the officer’s wounds to the front and side of his head and to his neck. He was flown by helicopter to a local hospital, where he died a short time later from the gunshot wound to the front of his head from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Officers located a 26-year-old suspect, who still had one handcuff on his wrist, in a nearby community and arrested him. He was charged with two counts each of Aggravated Murder, Escape, and Resisting Arrest, one count of Carrying Concealed Weapons, and three counts of Tampering with Evidence.", "id.num": 998}, "meta":

p.m. on January 7. The veteran officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience at the time of the incident, was on patrol when a man wearing a long white garment approached his vehicle and fired 12 rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun in his direction at close range. The officer, who was wearing body armor, stopped his vehicle and exited. He then exchanged gunfire with the suspect. The victim officer was struck three times in the arms/hands. Two officers, who were also on patrol nearby, responded to the gunshots. They saw the officer exchanging gunfire with the suspect, who ran off and appeared to be removing the white garment as he ran. The officers followed in their vehicle, shouting out to the man to stop and get on the ground. The suspect complied, lying on the ground with his arms outstretched in front of him. Officers exited their vehicle and placed the man under arrest. One of the officers located a firearm wrapped in a white garment not far from the scene. The 30-year-old suspect was taken to a local hospital and treated for wounds he received in the exchange of gunfire with the victim officer. He was charged with Attempted Murder, Aggravated Assault, Aggravated Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, Firearms Law Violation-Former Convict, and Firearms Law Violation-No License. His prior criminal record included a violent crime and weapons violation; he was on probation at the time of the incident.

{"text": "On July 17, a police officer with the Hawaii County Police Department was killed while answering a call for service in Mountain View. At 9:47 p.m., officers began communicating with each other via radio about a wanted suspect possibly parked alongside the highway. While responding to an unrelated call, one officer replied that he had seen a blue sedan parked in the same area with a single occupant in the driver’s seat. Four officers responded to the scene in separate vehicles. Three officers parked behind the suspect vehicle and walked to the rear of it but could not see inside because of the vehicle’s dark window tint. A fourth officer arrived and parked 10 feet in front of the suspect vehicle to illuminate it with his headlights. The officers could clearly see the empty passenger and back seats, but the driver’s seat and headrest were not visible. This led the officers to believe that the seat was fully reclined. One officer knocked on the trunk of the suspect vehicle and saw the driver’s seat pop up with a male sitting inside. Twice, the occupant opened the door about a foot, then closed it while ignoring the officers’ commands to exit the vehicle. Officers could see him moving inside the vehicle but could not tell what he was doing. The driver’s door opened a third time, and officers saw a single hand come up and out of the door. The driver said he was coming out of the vehicle. The 46-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, walked to the driver’s side door, and the suspect immediately fired five rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer in the front below his waist/groin area and fatally in his neck/throat. The other officers returned gunfire, but the suspect fled on foot. Despite a canvass of the area, the suspect remained at large. The victim officer, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 10 years’ experience, died the next day. On July 18, a multijurisdictional task force issued a media release seeking information from the public and began searching for the suspect by contacting confidential sources and informants. Using telephone numbers obtained from confidential sources, investigators narrowed the search to a single phone line and tracked it to the southern point of Hawaii Island. On July 20, the Special Response Team began screening vehicles departing the area. At 2:45 a.m., the team checked a vehicle with a male driver and two female passengers. The officers thought the rear cargo compartment looked staged, with a blanket covering the back and groceries propped up in front of it. Two team members opened the rear hatch, patted the blanket, and noticed movement under it. Suddenly, two rounds were fired from under the blanket in the direction of the officers. One team member fell backward, and the other returned gunfire. Two other team members also returned gunfire. A female emerged from under the blanket with her arms raised, and the body of a male rolled out of the compartment, justifiably killed by the officers’ gunfire. The male was identified as the suspect who had killed the officer 3 days prior. The suspect was 33 years old and was on probation and conditional release pending criminal prosecution at the time of the incident. He was known to possess and use controlled substances, and his criminal history included incarceration and previous arrests for a drug law violation, a weapons violation, other crime of violence, and resisting arrest. Investigators suspect this was a suicide-by-cop incident. The wounded Special Response Team officer sustained a gunshot wound to his front upper torso/chest and has since been released from the hospital.

the Chicago Police Department died of injuries he sustained while working a tactical assignment 29 years earlier. On July 14, 1988, at 4:45 p.m., the 37-year-old officer was a 7-year veteran of law enforcement and a member of the Hostage, Barricade, and Terrorist Team. The officer was involved in an 8-hour standoff with a subject who had barricaded himself inside a residence. During the incident, the officer was positioned behind a garage and was looking around the corner of the structure at the residence when the offender fired once with a .44-caliber handgun. The officer was hit in the front head above his eye, and the round lodged behind his ear. The officer was transported to a local hospital where he underwent surgery to remove the round from his brain. The 46-year-old offender, who was a retired Chicago police officer, was arrested the same day. He was charged with Aggravated Battery (Firearm) and Attempted Murder. He died in custody. The victim officer never fully recovered from his injury and was wheelchair bound for the rest of his life. He died from complications resulting from his brain injury. The Chicago Medical Examiner’s office ruled his death a homicide.", "id.num": 170}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.761934Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T21:30:41.726212Z", "inner_id":

The veteran officer, who had more than 11 years of law enforcement experience, was accompanying a Kentucky state trooper to a residence to investigate an individual with regard to a stolen vehicle. When the officer and trooper arrived at the house, they encountered some individuals in a vehicle in the driveway. The trooper went to speak with these people, and the officer went to the front door and knocked in an effort to locate the suspect. With no response at the door, the officer noticed footprints in the snow that led to the back of the house. The officer, who was wearing body armor, followed the footprints as the trooper continued interviewing the individuals in the driveway. Shortly after the officer disappeared from view, the trooper heard shots fired. He called for assistance and followed the sounds of gunfire. Additional officers responded to the scene and the victim officer was found a short time later, near an outbuilding of an adjacent residence, fatally shot in the front of the head by a .45-caliber automatic handgun. The 55-year-old suspect, a known felon who had a history of violence and drug law violations, was located the next day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, and Possession of a Stolen Firearm.

sheriff with the Loudon County Sheriff’s Department was shot and killed when he responded to a domestic violence call in which a juvenile had attacked his mother with a fence post. When the 24-year-old deputy, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the home in Lenoir City and exited his vehicle, the juvenile apparently shot him in the chest with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. Additional officers arrived at the scene and saw the victim officer lying on the ground. However, the suspect opened fire on them from inside the home, forcing the officers to retreat. Members of the Knox County Sheriff’s Department Extradition Team arrived and were able to retrieve the victim officer’s body. After 3 hours without any contact with the shooter, the officers sent a robot into the house to determine if there was any movement inside. The individual then exchanged gunfire with officers for about 30 seconds. Over the next 23 hours, officers deployed several canisters of tear gas and made numerous attempts to make contact with the suspect by public address system and by telephone. About 11 a.m. on March 13, a K-9 team entered the garage and listened for about an hour for any movement in the home. After hearing nothing, the team entered the house to clear each room. The team found the 16-year-old shooter, who had no known prior criminal record, in an upstairs bedroom dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. A veteran Jackson Police Department sergeant, with over 30 years of law enforcement experience, was shot and killed while in pursuit of a robbery suspect. The 52-year-old sergeant was assisting other officers in a vehicle pursuit of a man who allegedly mugged a shopper earlier on the day of June 17 in the parking lot of a nearby mall. It was around 9:30 in the morning when the pursuit ended as the suspect crashed his vehicle in the parking lot of a dry cleaning business. The suspect exited his wrecked car and fired at least two shots from a .32-caliber revolver into the passenger window of the sergeant’s patrol unit. The sergeant exited his vehicle; other officers on the scene realized that he had been shot in the lower stomach and provided assistance. The sergeant was transported to a nearby hospital where he died during surgery. Additional officers pursued the suspect who had fled the scene of the shooting on foot. During the course of the pursuit, the 20-year-old suspect was shot by pursuing officers. The suspect was transported to the hospital where he recovered from his wound and was subsequently charged with First-Degree Murder.", "id.num": 617}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Just before 3 p.m., two officers were dispatched to the call at a local park. The 29-year-old EPD officer, a veteran with more than 7 years of law enforcement experience, was on patrol and responded to the call as an additional unit. As the officer, who was wearing body armor, approached a creek in the park, the suspect opened fire with a .45-caliber semiautomatic weapon. The officer was struck in the front of the head. The suspect then began firing at the other two officers on scene. The officers encouraged the suspect to surrender, but instead, he positioned himself beside of the motionless victim officer and continued to fire. Additional officers arrived with sniper rifles and observed through their scopes that the victim officer appeared to be gravely injured. One of the officers fired two rounds at the suspect with the scoped rifle. The suspect stopped shooting and assisting officers were then able to safely respond to the injured officer and suspect. The senior police officer succumbed to his injury later that day. The 22-year-old suspect had been justifiably killed.

The first to arrive, the senior police officer met with one of the store’s night managers who went with the officer to approach the man near the produce section. When the officer told the man he needed to speak with him, the man ran towards the store’s exit. The officer chased the suspect and tackled him near the exit. During the struggle, the suspect produced a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds behind his back, one round striking the officer in the front upper torso/chest, which was protected by his body armor, and another round fatally wounding the victim officer in the neck/throat. Two store employees subdued the suspect and took the handgun away from him. Another employee used the victim officer’s radio and called for help, stating the officer had been shot. Responding officers and emergency medical personnel attempted CPR on the victim officer, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The 24-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record, which included drug violations, was arrested and charged with Capital Murder.

"agreement": 41.21492704826038, "data": {"text": "A patrol officer with the Auburn Police Department (APD) was severely injured at 6:25 p.m. on February 15. The 30-year-old officer was shot while investigating an armed robbery that had taken place earlier that day. At 5:30 p.m., the APD received a call reporting an armed robbery in progress at a business. The caller believed the suspect possessed a firearm and an explosive. When officers arrived at the business, the suspect had fled in a vehicle. Officers collected the description of the suspect and getaway vehicle and broadcast the information to all law enforcement personnel in the area. Less than an hour later, the APD officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 5 years’ experience, saw the suspect’s vehicle traveling on a roadway that was less than a mile from the location of the robbery.  When the suspect turned his vehicle into a nearby parking lot, the officer followed and activated his emergency lights to initiate a traffic stop. Before approaching the vehicle, the officer observed that the driver was female and determined that the male passenger fit the description of the suspect; therefore, the officer approached the passenger side. The officer’s body camera and in-car dash camera footage showed the suspect refused to obey the officer’s commands to keep his hands in sight. The officer saw the suspect draw a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The officer, who was wearing body armor, reached inside the vehicle through the window to control the armed offender, but the offender shot the officer in the side of his head. The officer fell back and attempted to seek cover. The offender exited the vehicle and continued firing at the injured officer. The offender fired 11 rounds at the officer, striking him six times. In addition to his head, the officer was shot in his rear upper torso/back, rear below his waist/buttocks, and his arms/hands. The officer took cover in a nearby ditch, and the offender returned to the vehicle and fled the scene. Witnesses called 911, and responding officers arrived about a minute after the offender fled. They rendered aid to the injured officer until emergency medical personnel transported him to a local hospital. Immediate investigation of the scene included reviewing video footage of the offender. Officers recognized him and knew his name. Around 9:45 p.m., APD officers gathered intelligence that the offender was at an apartment approximately 5 miles away from the scene of the shooting. Lee County SWAT arrived at the apartment, and as they were detaining the residents, officers saw the offender inside. He began shooting at the officers, and the officers returned fire. The offender retreated to a room in the back of the residence. Shortly after, officers realized the room the offender was in was on fire, and they retreated and set up a perimeter around the building. The local fire department responded and extinguished the blaze. Law enforcement found two bodies inside the burned room, that of the offender and the female driver. The autopsy reports showed the female had been shot in the head and had died before the fire started. Her death was ruled a homicide. The 38-year-old offender died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was wanted on a felony warrant and had a criminal history that included a drug law violation and a weapons violation. The injured APD officer has since returned to duty.", "id.num": 1118}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.762093Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T22:02:39.245959Z", "inner_id": 53,

17 near Whiteville as he attempted to conduct a traffic stop for a speeding violation. The veteran trooper, who had 12 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a truck around 12:10 a.m. When he approached the truck on foot, the driver fired multiple rounds from close range, then fled the scene. Two rounds struck the trooper in the side of his head and the front upper torso/chest. He died at the scene. A passerby discovered the trooper’s body a few minutes later and contacted the authorities. When officers arrived, they reviewed the video from the trooper’s dashboard camera and issued an all points bulletin for the truck. Approximately an hour after the shooting, a Fair Bluff Police Department officer observed the suspect’s truck. The officer and the driver engaged in a short chase followed by a foot chase before the officer lost sight of the suspect. Other officers and NCHP troopers arrived on scene and established a perimeter. At approximately 4 a.m., officers took the 20- year-old suspect into custody without incident. The suspect was on probation for firearm-related offenses. The truck had been stolen from a business in Chadbourn. In an interview conducted by special agents with North Carolina’s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI), the suspect said he had no knowledge of the shooting and claimed he had rented the truck from an unknown individual. He said he fled from law enforcement officers in Fair Bluff because he had been drinking and driving. The suspect was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. In the following days, video footage from a gas station near Tabor City showed the suspect had been a passenger in the truck, and a second man was actually the driver. The truck had left the gas station approximately 16 minutes before the trooper was killed at the traffic stop, which happened to be the driving time between the two locations. Further investigation indicated the driver was the actual shooter. Agents with the SBI Criminal Apprehension Team accessed the new suspect’s social media accounts and telephone numbers and located him in Loris, South Carolina. On October 23, SBI agents coordinated with South Carolina authorities and took the new suspect, who was on probation, into custody without incident. The 18-year-old suspect was charged with First-Degree Murder and Possession of a Firearm by a Felon. His criminal history included incarceration for a violent crime. In a subsequent interview, the first suspect told agents that the second suspect killed the trooper and that he had previously lied because the second suspect had pointed the firearm at him several times after the shooting and threatened to kill him if he told anyone.", "id.num": 364}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.762126Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T22:03:53.170644Z",

The veteran detective, who had more than 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with the Little Elm SWAT team to a report of a person with a firearm. The first officers arrived on the scene and found the subject standing in his yard holding a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. When officers challenged the subject, he barricaded himself inside the residence. Patrol officers established a perimeter and called for the SWAT team. The detective, who served as a marksman observer, arrived and established an observation point behind a vehicle. He covered the corner of the subject’s residence and the door the subject had entered when he fled. While the negotiator was trying to establish contact with the subject, the subject fired one round from inside the residence, striking the roadway in the direction of the detective. Within a minute, the subject fired a barrage of rounds in the direction of the detective through a window in the door. The victim detective, who was wearing protective body armor, was fatally struck once in the throat. A fellow officer positioned near the victim and an officer stationed on the perimeter fired at the subject, justifiably killing him. The 46-year-old subject was known to the police department for domestic violence incidents. He had prior arrests for assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest, evading detention, a weapons violation, and a violent crime.", "id.num": 45}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

investigating suspicious persons and circumstances near a local hotel around 10:30 p.m. on January 23. The officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience at the time, was sitting in his marked patrol vehicle when he noticed two men in a van pull into a hotel across the street. He ran the van’s license plate number and learned that the van was registered to a man who had three outstanding arrest warrants. The officer drove into the hotel’s parking lot and saw the van was now backed up to the door of a hotel room, and the two individuals were unloading items from the van into the room. The officer parked his vehicle, got out, and approached the driver. He asked the man if he was the owner of the van; the man said he was. The officer told the man that he was under arrest, and he attempted to take him into custody. However, the man resisted and pulled away from the officer, who sent out a call for backup via his portable police radio. As the two struggled, the officer’s right arm became tangled with the subject’s left arm. Then, the officer, who was wearing body armor, heard two gunshots and felt a burning sensation in his left arm and the left side of his chest. Realizing he had been shot, the officer disengaged from the subject, took cover in an adjacent lot, and notified responding officers that he had been shot. The suspect, armed with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, approached the open door of the van and fired additional rounds at the officer but missed. The suspect then got into the van and drove through the parking lot. At the same time, officers from the Swartz Creek Police Department (SCPD) arrived at the scene. The first SCPD officer pulled his vehicle into the parking lot and drove through a snow bank to position himself behind the van. The second SCPD officer stopped his vehicle behind the first SCPD officer’s car. The suspect stopped the van, put it in reverse, and rammed the first SCPD officer’s vehicle. Then, the suspect exited the van and fired at the first SCPD officer who was still seated in his car. The first SCPD officer returned fire, striking the man several times. The second SCPD officer exited his vehicle and sought cover behind it as the suspect started shooting at him. After being shot, the offender eventually fell to the ground, and officers arrested him. The 55-year-old man was taken to a local hospital for treatment. He was charged with two counts of Assault with Intent to Murder, Carrying a Concealed Weapon, Possession of a Weapon by a Felon, Assaulting/Resisting/Obstructing a Law Enforcement Officer—Causing Serious Bodily Injury, and Attempting to Kill a K-9. The victim patrol officer was also taken to a local hospital for treatment to his wounds, including the one to his chest that had been covered by the officer’s protective vest. The wounded officer has since returned to duty.", "id.num": 1078}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.762247Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T22:09:32.891160Z", "inner_id": 58,

officer with the DeKalb County Police Department sustained severe injuries while checking on the welfare of a citizen in Lithonia. On July 31 beginning at 11:50 p.m., DeKalb County Communications received three phone calls in quick succession from the same number in Lithonia. The operator received little information from the calls but was able to discern that a female caller was being threatened by someone in the residence. Four minutes later, three officers responded to the address. Finding no lights on, the officers knocked on the door but received no answer. The officers looked around the outside of the residence but saw nothing alarming. The officers requested the dispatcher phone the complainant. When no one answered the call, the officers left the scene. At 12:29 a.m., another female called from a different phone number and reported that a family member called and awakened her, saying that during an argument, the caller’s son had shot his girlfriend. The caller immediately hung up. Three officers (two of whom were at the residence earlier) were dispatched to the scene. The operator called the complainant back and confirmed that the complainant’s son had shot his girlfriend, and that he was shooting at the officers who had already arrived at the residence. Body camera footage shows that as the three officers approached the front door of the residence, they encountered rifle fire from the subject inside. The 48-year-old officer, who had almost 3 years of law enforcement experience, was struck by three rounds, sustaining injuries below his body armor in front below his waist/groin area, his rear lower torso/back, and his arms/hands. As the officers took cover, the wounded officer discharged seven rounds from his service weapon in the direction of the gunfire, and another officer fired one round. None of the rounds struck the offender. The third officer radioed dispatch and alerted them that shots had been fired and an officer was injured. One of the assisting officers administered first aid to the wounded officer and escorted him to an emergency medical services unit. From there, the officer was transported to a local hospital where he underwent surgery. Meanwhile, the DeKalb County SWAT Team, Bomb Unit, K-9 Unit, Traffic Aggressive Control Team, and Aerial Support Unit responded to the scene. The SWAT Team entered the residence and found a deceased female with a chest wound in a second-floor bedroom. After the scene was cleared, a K-9 team began tracking the offender, locating his cell phone and a white shirt in the yard next door to the incident location. K-9 teams continued tracking the offender into the night and the next day with no results. On August 8 at 10:30 p.m., the Fugitive Unit, in conjunction with the K-9 Unit and U.S. Marshals, performed a vehicle traffic stop at a gas station in Lithonia and arrested the offender, who was a passenger in the vehicle, without incident. The 27-year-old offender was charged with Second-Degree Murder, three counts of Aggravated Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer, Damage to Property, Possession of a Firearm or Knife/Cutting Instrument During a Crime, Probation Violation, and Battery/Family Violence. His criminal history included charges for aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, and resisting arrest. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured officer had not returned to duty.", "id.num": 1157}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.762346Z", "updated_at":

Public Safety (BCDPS) was shot and wounded while assisting in a tactical situation. Earlier that morning, a BCDPS task force learned a subject had violated his conditional release bond the previous day. Around 10 a.m., three BCDPS officers in unmarked vehicles began physical surveillance of the suspect’s residence. At approximately 10:30 a.m., the suspect came outside the residence to greet a male visitor. The man and the suspect both entered the residence. Slightly more than an hour later, the officers saw the man and the suspect leave the residence. Both men got into their vehicles, the man drove away first, and seconds later the suspect followed. Both vehicles turned onto another street, where a uniformed BCDPS officer in a fully marked patrol unit was positioned to enact a traffic stop on the suspect. One of the plainclothes officers joined the uniformed officer at the side of the road, where the uniformed officer ordered the suspect to exit his vehicle. However, the suspect disregarded the order and sped away. The two officers ran back to the marked patrol unit, and a vehicle chase ensued. The officer in the passenger’s seat notified dispatch of the pursuit, as the suspect led the officers back to his residence. The suspect parked his vehicle in his driveway, jumped out, and ran toward a basement window on the north side of the house. The plainclothes officer exited the patrol unit and continued the chase on foot. When the suspect reached the basement window, he broke the glass and attempted to dive inside. However, he got stuck halfway through the opening with his right arm and right leg still outside the window. The officer grabbed the suspect’s arm and attempted to pull him back outside. During the struggle, the uniformed officer arrived to assist. When the suspect’s arm slipped from the plainclothes officer’s grasp, the suspect fell into the basement, and the officer stumbled backward. The uniformed officer covered the window and ordered the suspect to come out. The plainclothes officer then ran back to the patrol unit, which was parked in the driveway, to turn off the vehicle’s siren. As he was running, he heard a single gunshot coming from the basement. After turning off the siren and starting back toward the basement window, the officer heard several more gunshots coming from the west side of the residence. He took cover at the corner of the street and saw that the uniformed officer had taken cover behind the front wheel located on the driver’s side of the patrol unit. He then noticed another one of the plainclothes officers had arrived to assist and had been struck in the rear lower torso/back with a round from the suspect’s 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded police officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 22 years of experience, had taken cover behind the rear wheel located on the driver’s side of his unmarked vehicle. Both the uniformed officer and the wounded plainclothes officer were trapped behind their vehicles with no escape routes from the suspect who had barricaded himself inside the residence. At that time, four additional BCDPS officers arrived on the scene. The initial plainclothes officer obtained a department-issued AR-15 rifle from the arriving officers and positioned himself to cover the officers who were still unable to move from their locations. Officers from other local agencies and the Michigan State Police Emergency Support Team also responded to assist. The suspect committed suicide several hours later. The 38-year-old man, who was known by law enforcement to deal drugs, had a prior criminal record including charges for a police assault, weapons violation, and drug law violation. The victim officer was treated at a nearby hospital for his injury and has since returned to duty.", "id.num": 625}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.762420Z", "updated_at":

The veteran officer, with more than 13 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner were the first team to enter the residence of a suspect wanted for attempted murder. Once inside, the officers loudly announced, “Police search warrant.” The officer’s partner noticed a subject rolling from the living room couch and scurrying on his hands and knees toward the kitchen. The officer pursued the subject and was able to pin him down on the kitchen floor with his ballistic shield. While the officer was securing the fleeing subject, his partner noticed a second subject at the top of a stairway and asked to see her hands. The subject’s hands were empty, and the partner turned to enter the kitchen where he heard gunfire. A third subject, who was hidden in a utility room adjacent to the kitchen, had opened fire with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer already in the kitchen three times in his protective vest and once, fatally, in the rear lower torso/back just below his body armor. Although he was mortally wounded, the victim officer was able to fire seven rounds with his service weapon in the direction of the offender. The victim officer’s partner also fired his weapon, striking the 25-year-old offender once.

Locust Grove Police Department (LGDP) patrol officer with nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience was shot and killed and two deputy sheriffs with the Henry County Sheriff’s Office were injured while attempting to gain control of a suspect around 10:55 a.m. on February 9. The two deputies, ages 48 and 62, were at a residence attempting to execute an arrest warrant on a suspect who failed to appear on a city ordinance violation. The suspect refused to comply with the deputies’ requests, so they radioed for assistance to take him into custody. When the LGDP officer arrived at the scene, the three officers, who were all wearing body armor, attempted to take the suspect into custody; however, the suspect resisted and retreated into his residence. The officers followed the suspect into the residence, and the man took a blunt object and struck the 62-year-old deputy in the head. The suspect then took out a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired at all three officers. The patrol officer was shot in the neck/throat, front upper torso/chest, and fatally in the side of the head. The deputy who was struck with the blunt object had fallen to the floor, but he was able to return gunfire, striking and justifiably killing the 39-year-old suspect. Both deputies were taken to a local hospital for treatment of their injuries. The 48-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 20 years of experience, suffered wounds to the side of his head and front lower torso/abdomen. He has since returned to duty. The 62-year-old deputy, also a veteran of law enforcement with 14 years’ experience, suffered injuries to the front of his head and front lower torso/abdomen. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, he had not returned to duty. The chief of police of the Ludowici Police Department was killed at 7:30 p.m. on September 15 while answering a call for service for traffic control. The 69-year-old chief, a 23-year veteran of law enforcement, was struck by a vehicle as he attempted to stop traffic and pedestrians from entering a roadway during a vehicle pursuit that began in a nearby county. Deputies from the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office, the Long County Sheriff’s Office, and the Georgia State Police were in pursuit of a vehicle that was headed toward Ludowici at speeds exceeding 100 mph. Deputies had deployed spike strips along the route, and despite the rear driver’s side tire being punctured, the vehicle continued to flee at speeds of 90 to 100 mph. The chief was attempting to clear traffic at the intersection as the vehicle approached. The driver of the vehicle targeted the chief, intentionally hitting him. The vehicle then left the roadway and fatally struck a motorcyclist at an adjacent gasoline station before it came to rest. The driver attempted to flee on foot but was quickly apprehended by state troopers. The chief was transported by ambulance to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The 23-year-old driver was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. He was transported to a hospital, where he was treated and released before being charged with Murder, First-Degree Homicide by Vehicle, Fleeing or Attempting to Elude Police for a Felony Offense, Driving Under the Influence, Speeding, Reckless Driving, Hit and Run Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury, Failure to Report an Accident with Injury or Damage, and Weaving Over the Roadway.

At 10:15 a.m. on June 21, the 59-year-old chief deputy, who had nearly 29 years’ law enforcement experience, was on patrol looking for a pickup truck involved in a home invasion and a minivan that had been stolen from the home. On a road in Tuscola, the veteran chief deputy met vehicles traveling toward him that matched the descriptions. As the suspects’ vehicles passed his, three bullets were fired from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun into the chief deputy’s vehicle, one striking him in the face and another striking him fatally in the chest. Despite his wounds, he was able to radio his location, the last location where the vehicles had been seen, to law enforcement. Two suspects, one 23 years old and the other 24 years old, abandoned the pickup truck and fled in the stolen minivan. The chief deputy was transported to a hospital in Urbana where he remained until his death. Members of the Illinois State Police (ISP) located the suspects’ vehicle and a high-speed chase ensued. During the chase, shots were fired at the police. ISP officers pursued the suspects until they entered the town of Arcola, where the suspects crashed the minivan. The 23-year-old suspect was immediately apprehended, but the 24-year-old suspect ran into a bank and held five people hostage at gunpoint. Following hostage negotiations with which additional ISP personnel and the FBI assisted, the suspect released the hostages unharmed and then surrendered. Both suspects had juvenile and adult criminal records that included violent crime and drug and weapons violations. The 23-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident. Both suspects had a history of prior mental disorders and were charged with Murder, Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, Attempted Armed Robbery, Armed Violence, Unlawful Possession of Weapons,

CHP officers were wounded shortly after 5:30 p.m. on August 12, in Riverside. The first officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, was on a patrol motorcycle and stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation at 4:54 p.m. The officer determined that the driver of the vehicle was unlicensed; the officer then prepared to impound the vehicle. At 5:04 p.m., the second CHP officer, a 34-year-old with more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene to assist. Without warning, the driver, who was now standing outside his vehicle, reached into his vehicle, retrieved a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle, and began firing at the officers. Footage from the assisting officer’s in-car dash camera showed that the officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect as the assisting officer radioed for backup. At 5:37 p.m., the third CHP officer, a 33-year-old veteran with nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene along with a fourth CHP officer; they joined the first two officers in the shootout. A short time later, officers from the Riverside Police Department and the Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner's Department arrived to assist. During the prolonged encounter, the suspect fired 120 rounds at the officers, and the officers returned gunfire with a total of 123 rounds. Three of the officers’ rounds struck the suspect, justifiably killing him. He was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. Eight of the suspect’s rounds struck the officers during the exchange of gunfire. The first CHP officer, who was wearing body armor and a motorcycle helmet, sustained gunshot wounds to the arms/hands, the shoulder (upper torso) area when the round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his vest, and a fatal wound to the side of his head. He was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The second and third responding CHP officers, who were also wearing body armor, suffered gunshot wounds to the front of their legs. They were transported by patrol units to a local hospital. The suspect’s wife, who was sitting in a separate vehicle adjacent to the suspect’s vehicle, was injured by flying glass. She was treated at the scene for minor injuries. The 49-year-old suspect was under the influence of amphetamines/ methamphetamines at the time of the incident. He had a prior criminal record including aggravated assault (excluding officers), assault on a law enforcement officer (aggravated or simple), domestic violence, a drug law violation, murder, threats against a law enforcement officer, and a weapons violation. The third officer to respond recovered from his injury and has since returned to duty. However, at the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured officer who was second to respond had not returned to duty.", "id.num": 325}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

March 24, a 21-year-old trooper with the Wisconsin State Patrol (WSP), Fond du Lac Post, was fatally shot while pursuing a suspect in an armed bank robbery and related homicide. In response to a broadcast that described the suspect and the vehicle he was driving, law enforcement positioned themselves at various locations in the region. At 5:33 p.m., the trooper radioed that he had seen the suspect’s vehicle and was following it from a distance without any emergency lights or siren activated. When the suspect drove his vehicle into a plaza with shops and restaurants, the trooper, who had more than 2 months of law enforcement experience, slowly followed in his squad car. As the vehicles neared the east side of the store, the suspect made a U-turn and shot the pursuing trooper through the driver’s side window of the squad car. The suspect exited his vehicle while it was still in drive and continued firing at the trooper, who exited his squad car—also still in drive—and returned fire. The two continued to exchange gunfire as they ran around the slowly moving squad car, and then the suspect ran toward an apartment building. During the exchange of gunfire, the suspect fired nine rounds from a 5.7x28 mm semiautomatic handgun, hitting the trooper at least once; the victim trooper returned fire, striking the offender with one round. The trooper’s squad car eventually stopped just northeast of the apartment building, and the suspect’s vehicle stopped near the corner of the store. The first assisting trooper to arrive witnessed the exchange and radioed “Shots fired!” to call for backup. She observed the victim trooper fall to the ground as he continued to shoot at the fleeing suspect. Moments later, another trooper arrived, called for additional backup from other local law enforcement, exited his patrol vehicle, and pulled the victim trooper behind the first responding trooper’s vehicle. The two administered first aid to the victim trooper. Although he was wearing body armor, the victim trooper sustained injuries to the front upper torso/chest, the rear upper torso/back (from a round that exceeded the vest’s specifications), the neck/throat, and his arms/hands. A captain with the WSP arrived and helped lift the trooper into a vehicle to transport him to a trauma center, but the victim trooper succumbed to his wound in the rear upper torso/back while en route to be airlifted. Meanwhile, law enforcement officers from the Fond du Lac Police Department and the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Department came to assist. These agencies provided armored response and rescue vehicles to cover officers on the scene and to approach the suspect, who was found lying south of the store near the apartment complex. Witnesses said they saw the suspect crawling from the area. Using the armored vehicle as cover, officers verified that the suspect was no longer a threat, removed the handguns near his body and in his possession, and then permitted paramedics to approach him. The 38-year-old male, who had a criminal record that included a violent crime, had been justifiably killed by rounds fired by the victim trooper.", "id.num": 640}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Police Department officer, a veteran with nearly 10 years of experience in law enforcement, was injured while responding to a robbery in progress shortly before 7:30 a.m. on April 11. As an employee at a check-cashing business was preparing to open the front door, a man approached, pointed a firearm at her, and ordered her to let him inside. As she opened the door, the employee pushed a portable panic button she was carrying. Once inside the business, the offender forced her to open interior doors, providing the employee an opportunity to enter a distress code into the alarm system. He restrained her with zip ties and told her to open the safe. When she hesitated, the offender sprayed her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. A second offender arrived at the door, and when the first offender had her open the door for him, she grabbed the keys to her vehicle, rushed outside, and tried to enter her vehicle as the two men attacked her. The officer arrived on the scene, and the employee broke free from her attackers and ran toward the officer, who was exiting his patrol unit. The two offenders began firing their weapons, one of which was a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, with many of the 15 rounds striking the officer’s vehicle and shattering the window and windshield. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was injured on the front and side of his head by shards of glass. The officer and the employee moved to the rear of the patrol unit, and the officer returned fire. A round struck one of the offenders in the leg, and he fell to the ground. The other offender tried to pull the wounded offender away, but was unable to do so and fled the scene on foot. Other officers arrived and took the 47-year-old wounded offender into custody. The wounded offender, who had a prior criminal record including charges for a violent crime, was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault on a Public Servant and Aggravated Robbery. The offender who fled discarded his outer clothing, handgun, and a two-way radio nearby. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the second offender had not been captured.

Deputies responded to that location but were then advised that the suspect had returned to his home in Clinton. The LCSO was also informed that there were several people in the suspect’s yard and that the suspect was inside the house. A deputy, who had 1½ years of law enforcement experience, traveled to the suspect’s residence along with a Laurens County investigator and three Clinton Department of Public Safety (CDPS) officers. After the deputy arrived at the suspect’s house, he exited his vehicle and was in the process of telling the people in the yard to leave the area when the suspect appeared in the front doorway and shot at him with a .357-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The deputy was struck in the chest by a round that entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor. He fell, then regained his footing and called for help on his police radio. The deputy made his way to cover behind a CDPS vehicle. Additional officers who had just arrived at the scene attempted to treat his wounds while other officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect. The suspect was wounded in the shootout, and officers were able to take him into custody. The victim deputy was taken to a local hospital where he died. The 39-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included violent crime and was under conditional release at the time of the incident, was charged with Murder, Use of a Weapon During the

warrants in Kinston. The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor. Four suspects, aged 26-, 18-, 17-, and 16-years-old, were subsequently arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The 18-year-old was also charged with a second count of First-Degree Murder. Each suspect, with the exception of the 16- year-old, had prior arrests.", "id.num": 895}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.762750Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T22:42:27.510185Z",

Johnson City Police Department was shot and killed with his service weapon while handling a person with a mental illness. Shortly after 7 a.m., a man called the emergency number and requested that officers come to a health services building. He explained to dispatchers he was concerned that terrorists may have attached a bomb to magnets in medical equipment housed in the facility. The man affirmatively stated to dispatchers that he believed people were going to die. Other people called dispatch after the man’s initial call and indicated there was a man “out of control,” with mental health issues at the health services location. The veteran officer, who had 18½ years of law enforcement experience, and another officer were dispatched to the health services business where the man who had called was preventing others from entering or leaving. The officers arrived in separate marked patrol vehicles. As the veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, attempted to exit his patrol vehicle, the man attacked him, punching the officer in the head. The individual was able to remove the officer’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. The officer yelled, “He’s got my gun.” The man then fired one round at close range, striking the officer in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The man then fired a second round at the victim officer in the rear of his head. The other officer, who had taken cover behind a vehicle, ordered the man to drop the firearm, but instead he walked toward the officer and fired rounds. The officer fired ten rounds at the man, striking him six times. The assailant fell to the ground, and the officer approached with his weapon ready. Despite his injuries, the assailant rose to his knees and grabbed the officer’s leg and pulled the officer to the pavement. As the officer and the assailant struggled on the ground, the officer fired two more rounds, striking the assailant. He continued to fight and managed to get his finger on the trigger of the officer’s weapon, discharging a round and causing the firearm to malfunction. A security guard from a nearby hospital and another person assisted the officer in subduing the assailant, who later died of his wounds at the hospital. The 43-year-old assailant did not have a history of mental illness. He was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident and had a prior criminal conviction.

deputy sheriff with the Harvey County Sheriff’s Office was fatally shot in the face during a tactical situation in which hostage negotiations broke down. He was a veteran officer with nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience. In the same incident, a 33-year- old veteran police detective from the Hesston Police Department sustained multiple bullet wounds but survived; he had 8 years of law enforcement experience at the time of the assault. Both men were wearing body armor and were part of a multi-department emergency response team (ERT) that had been dispatched with a separate team of hostage negotiators as a result of a 911 emergency call. In the late evening of April 8, a young female called the Newton Police Department and indicated that her mother was engaged in a domestic disturbance with the mother’s boyfriend. The caller reported that the suspect was armed. Responding officers declared that it was a hostage situation, since the suspect was allegedly holding an adult female against her will inside the residence. The ERT members and hostage negotiators arrived and established a perimeter barricade. About 3:10 a.m. the negotiators spoke on the phone with the suspect and the victim. At that time, the suspect denied that he had any weapons and agreed to a face-to-face meeting with the negotiators at the door of the residence. The ERT members escorted two negotiators through the perimeter barricade. The suspect opened the front door of the residence but not the storm door. The negotiators asked him how they could help to resolve the situation. The suspect would not let the female go outside, but he did turn on the living room light, making it possible for the negotiators to see her standing in the room. She said something to the suspect that apparently angered him, and he slammed the door shut. Immediately after that, the negotiators and officers reportedly heard him hitting the female and her subsequent screams. Believing that the hostage was in imminent danger, the officers forced their way into the residence using a ballistic shield. As the ERT members entered the residence, the suspect immediately fired multiple rounds from a .45- caliber semiautomatic handgun. He mortally shot the deputy sheriff, who was the first ERT member to cross the threshold. The suspect then shot the detective, who received wounds to his hands, arm, and leg. Other ERT members returned gunfire and removed the wounded men from inside the house. The detective, who was wearing a SWAT uniform with police lettering, was taken to a local hospital and recovered from his wounds but has not returned to duty. The 46-year-old suspect surrendered around 8 a.m. His prior criminal record included violent crime and police assault. He was a known drug dealer and was under the influence of narcotics and alcohol at the time of the incident. He was charged with Capital Murder, Attempted Capital Murder (2 counts), Criminal Possession of a Firearm, and Aggravated Kidnapping.", "id.num": 728}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Around 7 a.m., police were called to a residence where shots had been fired. When officers arrived, emergency medical services were already on the scene, and personnel were tending to a female victim. A suspect had fired shots into a residence, and glass from a broken window caused a wound to the woman’s chest. Several members of the woman’s family told officers that the suspect fled to another residence where he was holding his wife and children hostage at gunpoint. The woman’s family members began to get into their cars to go to the suspect’s location. Fearing an active shooter incident, officers went to the residence where the suspect was reported to be and stopped the victim’s family members from entering. Officers saw a man lean through a broken front window of the residence and point a pump-action shotgun at them, advising them to back up. The officers cleared the area, and additional responding units set up a perimeter that included the area near the residence. They also established a command post in a nearby street. Several times, the man leaned out of the broken window or the front door, sometimes holding a handgun, before quickly going back into the residence. Then, a young female exited the front door carrying a small child, and officers guided them to the nearby command post. Approximately 30 minutes later, the front door opened again, and a young male who was carrying another small child exited the residence; they were also directed to the command post. Sometime later, a SWAT team arrived and took over the scene. At 10:29 a.m., the suspect exited the house, jumped off the porch, and fired two shots from a pump-action shotgun at officers. The corporal, a 15-year veteran of law enforcement who was wearing body armor, was wounded in the front of his head. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. Medic teams on site attended to the victim corporal and the suspect. The 25-year-old suspect was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead, justifiably killed by officers.

September 11 at 9:55 p.m. during a foot pursuit of an individual who had run from a traffic stop. On the evening of the incident, two officers conducted a traffic stop, during which the lone occupant of the vehicle fled on foot. The officers initiated a foot pursuit and called for additional help. Responding to the officers’ call for assistance, the veteran sergeant, who had nearly 7 years’ law enforcement experience, and his patrol partner exited their cruiser within a block of the vacant vehicle and proceeded on foot toward it. Upon observing a man hiding in some bushes, the sergeant, who was wearing protective body armor, and his partner ordered the man to come out. However, the man fired a single shot from a .45- caliber semiautomatic handgun, hitting the sergeant in the front of the head. The alleged shooter, a known drug dealer with an extensive criminal record, then left the cover of the shrubbery. In an exchange of gunfire, the sergeant’s partner, who remained unharmed, wounded the suspect. Both the victim sergeant and the 21-year-old suspect were transported to an area medical center. The suspect died the next day, and the sergeant died 8 days after the incident.", "id.num": 280}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.762915Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T22:47:54.182962Z",

27-year-old patrol officer with the Mobile Police Department was shot and killed while answering a call for service. The incident began at 9:30 p.m. after a call to investigate a deceased female lying in a roadway who appeared to have suffered blunt force trauma to the back of her head. While at the scene, officers interviewed two people familiar with the deceased individual. It was reported that she left her home earlier in the evening to pick up her ex-husband for choir practice. Later, her car was spotted in her ex-husband’s driveway. A detective on scene requested additional officers to accompany him to the ex-husband’s residence. The detective met the 27-year-old officer and a second officer at the precinct; the three of them arrived at the ex-husband’s home at 11:23 p.m. They saw the deceased female’s car in the driveway, so they took positions of cover. The detective and the 27-year-old officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, went to the rear of the home; the other officer took cover behind a tree in the front yard. The detective spoke via cell phone to other detectives who were still at the original scene and decided not to attempt to contact anyone inside the residence. The 27-year-old officer returned to his marked patrol vehicle, which was parked down the street, to retrieve his department-issued rifle. He then joined the officer who was positioned behind the tree at the front of the house. The officers briefly spoke about contacting their superior officers, as they had been requested to do. The 27-year-old officer radioed dispatch. Just as he ended his radio transmission, an individual inside the home fired at the officer from a distance of 45 feet with a .38-caliber revolver. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was struck once in the front of the head. He immediately fell to the ground and was unable to take any action. The officer behind the tree fired twice, but both rounds struck the home. The uninjured officer notified dispatchers of the situation. The suspect continued to fire his weapon intermittently as responding officers extracted the victim officer from the scene. In all, the 72-year-old suspect fired eight rounds. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly before midnight. Officers held their positions until SWAT personnel arrived. Attempts to negotiate with the suspect began at 12:40 a.m., but no contact was made. At approximately 2 a.m., SWAT members inserted a reconnaissance robot into the home. The robot located the suspect, who had committed suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. The suspect had a criminal history that included a violent crime.

The incident began when Lebanon Police Department (LPD) officers attempted to serve a warrant, and three suspects fled in a vehicle. A pursuit involving the LPD and the BCSO ensued. At some point during the pursuit, a suspect exited the vehicle and began to flee on foot. The veteran deputy, who had more than 7 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner left their vehicle and chased after the fleeing suspect. As the deputy, who was wearing body armor, rounded the corner of a building, the suspect turned and fired three rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. One round struck the deputy in the front of the head. The suspect then ran between buildings and encountered responding officers, who fired seven rounds, one of which struck the suspect in the side. The victim deputy was taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on March 5. The 21-year-old suspect was also taken to the hospital and released on March 3. He was arrested and charged with Murder, Resisting Law Enforcement, Carrying a Handgun without a License, and Possession of Methamphetamine.

The patrol officer, who was a 5½-year veteran of law enforcement, was sitting in his police cruiser waiting for backup outside the house where a 911 call around 8:20 p.m. indicated that there was a man inside with a gun. While the telephone line remained open, the dispatcher heard what sounded like a struggle, then gunshots. A second officer arrived at the scene and reported that an officer was down. Additional units were called to the scene. Approximately 8:30 p.m., a sergeant arrived and found a woman standing in the street crying and yelling, “He’s been shot, the cop’s shot.” She told the sergeant that the victim officer was in his car. The sergeant told the woman to return to her house and remain there, and he ran to the patrol officer’s vehicle, where he found the victim patrol officer slumped in the front seat with a gunshot wound to his head. Because of the initial “officer down” call, medical personnel already had been dispatched. Within minutes of the sergeant’s arrival, an ambulance arrived at the scene and rushed the patrol officer to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later of the head wound from a round from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. Further investigation showed that the victim patrol officer, who was wearing body armor, was also shot in the chest but had been able to fire two shots from his service weapon before he was fatally wounded. They also found the body of another man in an upstairs bathroom. Apparently, the suspect had shot and killed the man in the bathroom and was attempting to run from the scene when he saw the patrol officer in the cruiser and had shot him. Twelve hours later, officers arrested a 32-year-old suspect when they located him in his mother’s residence. The suspect had a criminal record that included murder, weapons violations, and drugs, and was also on parole at the time of the incident. He was charged with two counts of Criminal Homicide, Burglary, Robbery, Illegal Possession of a Firearm, Possession of a Firearm without a License, Possession of a Firearm with an Altered

responding to a disturbance call at 1:30 p.m. on February 26 in Columbia. The 45-year-old veteran deputy, who had more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, was patrolling in her marked vehicle when a woman with blood on her face flagged her down. The deputy pulled her vehicle into a nearby drugstore parking lot and then exited to speak with the woman. The woman reported she had been assaulted and described the male attacker. The deputy radioed for an ambulance and informed dispatchers of the situation. The deputy returned to her patrol vehicle and began searching for the suspect around a nearby gas station. While driving, the deputy noticed a suspicious-looking man standing between two parked buses. As the deputy stopped her vehicle, the subject, who fit the description of the assailant, came out from between the two buses and began to run toward the deputy. The deputy, who was approximately 6 feet from the subject, attempted to use an electronic control device on him, but the device malfunctioned. The subject began to run away and the deputy radioed that she was in a foot pursuit, and responding officers joined in the chase. At one point, the subject turned and fired a handgun at one of the pursuing officers, who responded by firing two rounds. Fearing for the other officer’s safety, the deputy fired three rounds from her service weapon, but the subject continued to flee. The pursuit led to an apartment complex where officers set up a perimeter. A K-9 was called in to track the subject. As the K-9 was tracking, a woman came around a corner of the complex and told officers the person they were looking for was in her apartment. The deputy radioed the information to dispatchers, and additional officers arrived at the scene. The subject then fled the apartment through the back door. As he was running, the subject began blindly shooting at the deputy with his right arm extended backward. The deputy immediately felt pain in her front upper torso/chest beneath her body armor. The victim deputy was able to fire 12 rounds at the suspect, killing him. The deputy checked herself for injuries and found a bruise underneath her body armor. She was taken by ambulance to a local hospital for treatment. She was released and has since returned to duty. The 24-year-old offender had a criminal history including violent crime, drug violations, and weapons violations.", "id.num": 511}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.763082Z",

August 30, a 28-year-old corporal with the West Columbia Police Department (WCPD) was wounded while answering a call for backup. A short time earlier, a WCPD officer responded to a report of an impaired man in a vehicle. The officer parked his patrol unit next to the man’s vehicle and approached the driver’s side door. The subject placed his vehicle in reverse, and the vehicle rolled backwards onto an adjacent street. The officer took hold of the side mirror and stopped the rolling vehicle. The subject was fidgeting and yelling, so the officer asked him what was wrong. The man ignored the officer and continued his erratic behavior. The officer asked the man to exit the vehicle, but the subject did not comply and stated he needed to make a phone call because he was out of gas. Tinted windows prevented the officer from seeing clearly inside the vehicle, so he called for backup. The corporal, who had nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, and two additional WCPD officers arrived at the scene. When one of the newly arrived officers opened the driver’s door of the vehicle, the man grabbed a 4-inch knife and held it to his own throat. The man stated that he had been released from prison recently, and he was concerned the officers were going to take him back to jail. The subject repeated that he wanted to make a call, so one of the officers offered to make the call if the man would put down the knife. Once again, the subject ignored the officer and continued to rant and complain. A WCPD sergeant arrived at the scene and asked the man what was wrong; he replied that the officers were trying to take him back to jail. During their conversation, the subject placed the knife on the vehicle seat. While distracting the man by talking to him, the sergeant passed his electronic control device behind his back to one of the other officers. At that point, the sergeant and two of the officers reached inside the vehicle and attempted to pull the man out. The subject pulled away, regained the knife, and started swinging it at the officers as he shouted, “Shoot me!” During the scuffle, the corporal, who was wearing body armor, sustained a cut on his left arm/hand near his palm. The suspect closed the vehicle door, so one of the officers used a baton to break the window. The sergeant ordered the suspect to drop the knife; the suspect tossed it out of the window onto the ground. The sergeant then ordered the suspect to exit the vehicle with his hands visible and to get on the ground. Again, the suspect complied. The officers detained the suspect without further incident and took him into custody. The 40-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had prior arrests that included a weapons violation and a violent crime. He was arrested and charged with Public Disorderly Conduct, Unlawful Weapon, and Assault on a Police Officer While Resisting Arrest. The corporal has since recovered from his injury and returned to duty.", "id.num": 646}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.763119Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T23:02:04.634188Z",

activity shortly before 8 p.m. on March 10. The 35-year-old agent and 51-year-old sergeant were dressed in civilian clothing and conducting surveillance of farm land reportedly being used for the illegal sale of vehicles and animals. Their initial drive-by prompted the officers to request backup officers. As the agent and the sergeant arrived at the farm in their unmarked vehicle, a sport utility vehicle (SUV) passed them and pulled alongside the road. A man exited the SUV and began to smoke a cigarette. When the agent exited his vehicle and walked toward him, the man started to run away. The officers advised him to stop, but the subject fled at full speed. Four additional subjects with weapons exited the SUV and fired at both officers; the sergeant returned fire. The agent, a veteran with 15 years of law enforcement experience, was struck by 15 rounds from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. He was wounded in his arms/hands and, fatally, in his rear upper torso/back. The agent died at the scene. The sergeant was struck in the side of his head and in his arms/hands. Backup officers responded to the scene and discovered the fatally wounded agent and wounded sergeant. The sergeant was transported to a local hospital. One of the offenders, who was 31 years old, was justifiably killed during the exchange of gunfire; the other three offenders fled. Two offenders, both of whom had prior criminal records for drug violations and weapons violations, were arrested the following day. A 25-year-old suspect was charged with Possession of a Weapon, Resisting a Law Enforcement Officer, and Aiding Prisoner Escape. A 23-year-old suspect was charged with Homicide, Possession of a Weapon, and Weapon Offense. The last suspect, a 27-year-old with a prior criminal record including drug violations and weapons violations, was arrested on May 22 and charged with Possession of a Firearm and Dangerous Drugs. All four suspects were known drug dealers. The wounded sergeant has since returned to duty.", "id.num": 595}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.763150Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T23:07:08.580555Z", "inner_id": 85,

A major with the Homecroft Police Department (HPD) arrived first and saw a car on its roof. He parked his patrol vehicle along the curb of the northbound lane. The lieutenant arrived shortly after and parked behind him. The major spoke to a witness who reported she was driving her vehicle northbound when the other vehicle came toward her at a high rate of speed, went airborne, flipped upside down, and landed. The major approached the driver’s side of the inverted vehicle and saw the driver suspended from his seat belt. He then checked on the passenger who was sitting in the grass outside of the vehicle. The lieutenant, a veteran with 20 years of law enforcement experience, approached the passenger’s side of the vehicle, stuck his head inside, and advised the driver not to move. The driver became agitated and started cursing; the lieutenant told him to stay calm and help was on the way. The driver then used a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shot several rounds at the lieutenant. The HPD police chief and an off-duty reserve deputy from the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office, who had arrived at the scene, returned fire, injuring the driver. After the gunfire ceased, the veteran lieutenant was on the ground. He had been wounded in the rear legs, rear upper torso/back, front lower torso/abdomen, arms/hands, front legs/feet, and fatally in the front upper torso/chest. The rounds entered his body armor between the side panels, armhole/shoulder area, and above the vest. A handgun with the slide locked back was found lying on the ceiling of the overturned car. Officers commanded the driver not to move and extracted him from the vehicle. A nurse who witnessed the accident ran to the lieutenant and began performing CPR before he was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The 28-year-old offender, who received gunshot wounds to the right cheek, right clavicle, and left arm, was transported to the hospital. The offender was under the influence of marijuana, cocaine, and other narcotics at the time of the incident. He also had a criminal record that included a drug law violation.

In the early morning hours of May 20, the agent, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 8 years’ experience, was off duty and spending time with his friends at a tavern. As they exited for the evening and made their way to their vehicles, they saw a man pacing in the parking lot and arguing with someone via cell phone. The man noticed the group looking at him, and he yelled and cursed at them for staring. He abruptly ended his phone call and accosted the group. The confrontation escalated, and the man produced a knife. The agent showed his badge and tried to calm the suspect down. The suspect slapped the badge out of the agent’s hand and thrust the knife at him, slashing the agent’s leg and his chin. The agent’s friends came to his aid while the offender turned and ran. The agent quickly got up and pursued the offender. The offender suddenly turned and, with a backhanded forearm motion, stabbed the fast-approaching agent in the left eye/front of his head. The agent dropped to the ground. Witnesses captured the offender a block away. Around 2:30 a.m., Pebble Hills Regional Command officers were dispatched to the address of the stabbing. The agent was taken to a local hospital for emergency surgery. The stab wound was found to be severe, extending past the agent’s eye and into his brain. He was placed on life support and succumbed to the injury 4 days later.

Earlier in the evening, a woman attended a fireworks display in a local park. While at the park, she realized that her cell phone was missing and probably stolen. She tracked the cell phone using GPS technology and drove to an address that was the likely location of her cell phone. The woman called police to report the stolen phone and to provide information regarding its probable location. A Salt Lake City PD officer met with the woman and her companion near the address of the residence where she suspected her phone to be. The officer and the woman agreed that she and her companion would stay in their vehicle parked away from the residence while the officer went to investigate. The officer would return and inform her of the status of her cell phone. The officer who spoke with the victim met the veteran officer at the residence indicated by the cell phone’s GPS signal. Upon arriving, the officers noted a party taking place, so they stood on the sidewalk and began a conversation with the individuals standing just inside the yard, which was surrounded by a short fence. When one of the officers asked to speak with the homeowner, a man came forward claiming he owned the residence. The officers explained they were investigating a possible cell phone theft. They told the homeowner that the phone’s GPS tracked the device to his residence. The homeowner denied knowledge of a stolen phone, said he needed to speak with his friends, and began speaking in a language the officers could not understand. To gain more information, one officer asked the homeowner and surrounding individuals if anyone had been at the local park for fireworks earlier; no one answered. The officer then asked the homeowner for his name and identification. The man refused to give his name or to provide his identification and told the officers twice to wait while he spoke with the other individuals present. After the officer insisted the subject provide identification, the homeowner said the officer “was on his property,” and he “knew his rights.” During the verbal confrontation with the homeowner, a 16-year-old male pulled out a cell phone, flashed its light in the officers’ direction, and said he was recording the incident. He and several other individuals instructed the homeowner not to cooperate. As the crowd became more agitated, one of the officers radioed for backup; however, his ear bud had been knocked loose, and he could not hear the dispatcher’s response. He then requested that the homeowner move away from the crowd, outside the fence, so they could speak in the driveway. As the homeowner walked out to meet the officers, several subjects followed. Officers directed the people to stand at a distance, but at least two subjects used cell phones to record video within an arm’s length of the officers’ faces, temporarily blinding them with the phones’ lights. One officer spoke with the homeowner while the veteran officer attempted to separate the angry and visibly intoxicated crowd that surrounded the officers on three sides. Because the 16-year-old male continued to be disorderly and ignore the officers’ orders to back up and stop shining the light directly in their faces, one officer tried to separate him from the crowd. The male was impeding the investigation, and the officer attempted to place the male in handcuffs but was unable to keep control of the subject’s arms. During the struggle, the officer noticed the homeowner, who was being vocal and appeared to be intoxicated, advancing on him from behind. The officer turned and blocked the homeowner, who fell backwards into the street. As the officer turned to check the position of the veteran officer, he saw the veteran officer was involved in a physical altercation with several men and women. He also witnessed the 16-year-old male make physical contact with the veteran officer from behind. Unbeknownst to the officer at the time, the 16-year-old male had removed the veteran officer’s folding pocket knife from his front pocket and stabbed the veteran officer in his rear lower torso/back, below his body armor. The officer ran to the victim veteran officer’s aid and attempted to knock the 16-year-old male suspect off balance, but the suspect locked his arms around the assisting officer, and they both fell to the ground. The suspect began to kick and punch the assisting officer. After a brief struggle, the suspect ran into the crowd. At that time, an additional officer and two detectives arrived to help regain control of the crowd. However, several of the subjects involved, including the 16-year-old male suspect, were headed toward the entry of the residence. Concerned the subjects were going to retrieve weapons, the officer pursued them and ordered the 16-year-old suspect to stop. When the suspect began to run, the officer grabbed his shirt as the suspect entered the screen door, pulling the officer inside. There, the suspect and two other men began to punch the officer and tried to push him out of the house. The backup officers entered the home to assist. During the struggle, officers used electronic control devices on two subjects to subdue and handcuff them. Meanwhile, medical personnel were summoned for the victim officer who sustained a stab wound from the knife that remained lodged in his rear lower torso/back below his body armor. The victim officer was admitted to a local hospital for his injuries. Once the scene was secure, an officer located a cell phone in the possession of the 16-year-old suspect that matched the description of the stolen phone. Further investigation revealed the phone belonged to the woman who reported it stolen. A 46-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record and conviction, was arrested and charged with Riot, Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, and Interference with Arresting Officer. The 16-year-old male was arrested and charged with Disarming a Law Enforcement Officer, Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, and Fleeing. The suspect had a prior criminal record including police assault, weapons violations, and drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. Both suspects were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. In addition, several other subjects from the scene were also taken into custody. The wounded veteran officer has since returned to duty.", "id.num": 1106}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.763262Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T21:46:55.147095Z", "inner_id": 88, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97056959, "annotations": [{"id": 32652144, "completed_by": {"id": 19178, "email": "spencerdotson@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "yzrpyg8YqD", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 14, "text": "February 25", "start": 3, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "sjWhTusAFA", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 28, "text": "12:04 p.m.", "start": 18, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "R3qH-y5nx2", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 43, "text": "30-year-old", "start": 32, "labels": ["Age"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Ea77wlUzND", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 58, "text": "police officer", "start": 44, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "s6w8Su8qDw", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 101, "text": "Pittsburg Police Department (PPD)", "start": 68, "labels": ["Department"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "acxo4huCXY", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 233, "text": "3 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 196, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "CYDY12koWP", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 485, "text": "knife with a 4-inch blade", "start": 460, "labels": ["Other_weapon"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "m7yVWSeD-i", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1006, "text": "amphetamine/methamphetamine", "start": 979, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "jsuwgX_Xv3", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 2255, "text": "Controlled Substance", "start": 2235, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "stqTdT22Jd", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 2382, "text": "drug", "start": 2378, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "dKy1D97k-L", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Assignment", "Citizen call"], ["Situation", "Encounter"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-14T20:07:58.036987Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T21:47:49.239838Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-14T20:06:10.792617Z", "lead_time": 169.377, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "bac755db-8305-4b36-8727-76410110b445", "import_id": null, "last_action": "updated", "task": 97056959, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19178}, {"id": 32867024, "completed_by": {"id": 19168, "email": "lillianellis@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "UMD_cd9sSR", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 245, "text": "long with", "start": 236, "labels": ["Age"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Q-rjMh0_-Q", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-18T03:47:14.596468Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T03:47:14.596483Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 5.203, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "3e398a96-a90c-4651-8f2c-15a58de947d6", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97056959, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19168, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19168}], "file_upload": "df0d124c-data5.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 0.0, "data": {"text": "On February 25 at 12:04 p.m., a 30-year-old police officer with the Pittsburg Police Department (PPD) suffered minor injuries while attempting to restrain an offender. The officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, along with two members of the Crisis Negotiation Team and others, responded to a call for service involving domestic violence between a father and a son at the father’s residence. The caller reported that the son was using a knife with a 4-inch blade to stab and slash into the metal screen security door and the exterior of the residence. Dashboard and body camera footage show that officers encountered the suspect about a block away from the residence, still armed with the knife. Officers repeatedly ordered the subject to drop the knife, but he did not comply. An officer deployed a less-lethal round, striking the subject in his abdomen to no effect, possibly because the subject was wearing a bulky jacket and was under the influence of amphetamine/methamphetamine. After again ordering the suspect to drop the knife, a second officer deployed an electronic control weapon, striking the subject in his temple and his chest to no effect. The subject continued to ignore commands to drop the knife, so the first officer fired another less-lethal round, striking the subject in the chest. At the same time, a third officer deployed her electronic control weapon, striking the subject in the chest, but these tactics were also not effective. A fourth officer deployed his K-9, who bit the subject’s left forearm. The subject tried to stab the K-9, so the 30-year-old PPD officer tackled the offender. During the ensuing physical altercation, the offender stabbed the 30-year-old PPD officer above his body armor, striking his left shoulder (upper torso) area. Another officer disarmed the offender and assisting officers handcuffed him and placed him in a restraint device because of his continued combative behavior. The injured officer was treated for his wound. He has since returned to duty. The 33-year-old offender was transported to a local hospital, then arrested and charged with Assault with Deadly Weapon—Not Firearm, Obstructing/Resisting Executive Officer, Use/Under the Influence of Controlled Substance.

They pulled over their patrol vehicle and ordered the suspect to stop for questioning. As the two officers exited their vehicle, the man pulled a rifle from under his coat and fired 17 shots at them. The 38-year- old officer was shot but eventually recovered. The younger officer, who had over 8 years of law enforcement service, was fatally wounded when the bullets penetrated his protective vest and entered his lower back.

The suspect was carrying a handgun at his side, and he ignored orders to drop his weapon as he walked down the street toward the deputy. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, repeatedly told the suspect to halt while pointing his service weapon at him.

The victim deputy was transported to a local hospital. He survived his wounds but, as a result of his injuries, suffered from quadriplegia. According to the medical examiner, the deputy’s death nearly 23 years later, at age 50, was a result of complications resulting from his paralysis.", "id.num": 523}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.763441Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T21:59:55.713637Z", "inner_id": 94, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97056965, "annotations": [{"id": 32813548, "completed_by": {"id": 19178, "email": "spencerdotson@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "hFzJdlT7zu", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 69, "text": "Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department", "start": 29, "labels": ["Department"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "oK8hkL7JX-", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 108, "text": "11:22 a.m.", "start": 98, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "c71P7ja38O", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 152, "text": "June 8", "start": 146, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "OfBYoa5Dof", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 193, "text": ".38-caliber revolver", "start": 173, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "KXlKHi6OUC", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 239, "text": "9 mm semiautomatic handgun", "start": 213, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Um9VxIntX3", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 338, "text": "41-year-old", "start": 327, "labels": ["Age"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "QWCpiURR43", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 405, "text": "13 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 367, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "nH4-mitRn5", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 535, "text": "31-year-old", "start": 524, "labels": ["Age"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "P77RAzgmeA", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 594, "text": "8 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 557, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "GhvWIsZjlT", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 2487, "text": "12-gauge shotgun", "start": 2471, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "7p74ISi-pN", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 3584, "text": "drug", "start": 3580, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "kerrT_Rl0R", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed", "Feloniously Killed"], ["Situation", "Ambush"], ["Suspect", "Killed"], ["Suspect", "Suicide"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "F_Aal-eEfC", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 353, "text": "police officer", "start": 339, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "DIn-8Z4szt", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 550, "text": "police officer", "start": 536, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-16T18:35:05.462530Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T22:01:52.555235Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-14T23:41:58.770358Z", "lead_time": 154512.89500000002, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "724146c4-a400-442e-8377-ba994434f7f7", "import_id": null, "last_action": "updated", "task": 97056965, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19178}, {"id": 32867067, "completed_by": {"id": 19168, "email": "lillianellis@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "5gC7mvZrrv", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 234, "text": "Two police officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department were killed in an ambush at 11:22 a.m. as they ate lunch at a restaurant on June 8.

A man armed with a .38-caliber revolver and a woman with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun entered the restaurant and began firing from close range at the two police officers. A 41-year-old police officer, with nearly 13 years of law enforcement experience, was struck in the arms/hands, front upper torso/chest, neck/throat, and fatally in the front and side of his head. A 31-year-old police officer, with 8 years of law enforcement experience, was fatally struck in the side and rear of his head. Both officers were wearing body armor. The male assailant then stole the victim officers’ weapons, and the man and woman exited the restaurant and headed to a large retail store nearby. They entered the retail store holding up their weapons, and the man exclaimed, “The revolution has started; the cops are coming. Get out!” A private citizen, who had a permit to carry a concealed weapon, followed behind the male assailant and attempted to engage him in the store. However, the female shot and killed the private citizen. The offenders met at the ammunition counter, where the man smashed the glass and loaded ammunition into the woman’s duffle bag. The woman then walked to the northwest corner of the store with the man several steps behind. Several police units arrived at the restaurant in response to the officer shootings. Witnesses told one of the officers that the assailants headed toward the retail store, and the officer ran to the rear of the store. Witnesses outside the store told him there was a man inside firing a weapon. The officer entered through a rear door of the store and moved toward the northwest corner of the building. He spotted the man carrying a duffle bag and a firearm. The officer went down the aisle parallel to that of the male offender with the intent of engaging him at the furthest west aisle of the store. Meanwhile, the female offender headed toward the officer’s location. When the officer turned a corner, he encountered the female. She raised her weapon, pointed it in the direction of the officer, and fired several shots. The officer returned fire, striking the woman once in the upper right shoulder, as he retreated down an aisle and exited the store. Outside, the officer provided the suspects’ locations to additional officers. The male offender, who now was carrying a 12-gauge shotgun in addition to the .38-caliber revolver, put on a load-bearing vest and a belt with 12-gauge cartridges. A sergeant and four officers entered the store from the back door. Two officers established positions to the east of the suspects, and they were met with gunfire. They returned fire as the other two officers moved south then west of the suspects, which established the officers in the tactical “L” position. The suspects fired several times at these two officers, who were unable to return fire. The sergeant maintained a central location between the two teams of officers and tried to make contact with the offenders. However, the man yelled to the officers, “Stand down, I am in charge now.” The 31-year-old male appeared briefly in an open position, and two of the officers fired at him. The man fell to the ground. It appeared that he tried to talk to his 22-year-old female counterpart, and she pointed her handgun at him several times. Then, she pointed the weapon at herself and shot herself in the head. The man, who had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime and drug violations, died at the scene. The woman, who had no known criminal history, was taken to a local hospital where she died a short time later.", "id.num": 1053}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.763481Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T22:01:52.684320Z", "inner_id": 95, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97056966, "annotations": [{"id": 32813603, "completed_by": {"id": 19178, "email": "spencerdotson@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "eyEBdh0ygk", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 13, "text": "42-year-old", "start": 2, "labels": ["Age"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "BZbv2H2wPN", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 28, "text": "patrol officer", "start": 14, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "lFtGIyxaS7", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 66, "text": "Moss Point Police Department", "start": 38, "labels": ["Department"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "2nTSMrjKtO", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 88, "text": "11:45 p.m.", "start": 78, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "CnqiqvUmmp", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 102, "text": "October 17", "start": 92, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "lfHVpuEUkJ", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 233, "text": "21 years’ law enforcement experience", "start": 197, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "gkzuqGWuKs", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed", "Accidentally Killed"], ["Assignment", "Police call"], ["Situation", "Encounter"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-16T18:37:12.945952Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T22:03:18.541564Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-16T18:35:16.900410Z", "lead_time": 190.77499999999998, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "758611a9-71b0-43ff-8a1e-2768d6992282", "import_id": null, "last_action": "updated", "task": 97056966, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19178}, {"id": 32867078, "completed_by": {"id": 19168, "email": "lillianellis@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "bi43FXTadk", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 215, "text": "1 years’ law enfo", "start": 198, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "lG1ho89QBF", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed"], ["Assaulted"], ["Assignment"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-18T03:48:09.108368Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T03:48:09.108384Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-18T03:48:08.659042Z", "lead_time": 7.243, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "09e3129e-1380-4ca3-80f6-dc75ebd825a7", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97056966, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19168, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19168}], "file_upload": "df0d124c-data5.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 10.0, "data": {"text": "A 42-year-old patrol officer with the Moss Point Police Department died about 11:45 p.m. on October 17 when the vehicle of a fleeing subject struck his patrol car.

The veteran deputy, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, noticed a vehicle driving erratically in a field of crops. The deputy drove his patrol unit into the field and attempted to contact the driver of the vehicle. As the deputy approached, the suspect drove further into the crops. The deputy activated his patrol unit’s overhead lights and radioed for backup. The vehicle was approximately 160 yards away when the driver turned it around and faced the deputy’s patrol unit. Without warning, the driver fired six rounds from a .25-06 bolt-action rifle at the deputy. All six rounds hit the deputy’s patrol unit. One of the rounds entered the vehicle and fatally struck the deputy in the front of his head. Another round exceeded the specifications of the deputy’s body armor and hit him in the front lower torso/stomach. Unable to reach the victim deputy on the radio, dispatchers called for backup. The responding deputies arrived at the field and located the victim deputy in his patrol unit. Before the deputies could extract him, the suspect began shooting at them from his nearby residence. The deputies retreated and waited for the SWAT team to arrive. When the SWAT officers arrived, they removed the victim deputy from his patrol unit. During the ensuing 12-hour standoff, the suspect occasionally fired upon the SWAT officers. Eventually, the SWAT officers took the 43-year-old suspect into custody. The suspect, a known drug possessor and user, was under the influence of narcotics and was on probation at the time of the incident.

The veteran deputy, who had more than 12 years of law enforcement experience, was off duty and on his way to mow grass at a residence near Abbeville when he spotted a suspicious vehicle occupied by two men. He contacted the Vermilion Parish SO and requested that a deputy be sent to the area. About 4 minutes later, the deputy again contacted the Vermilion Parish SO to determine the location of the responding unit, and he also indicated that he was going to attempt to intercept the suspicious persons as they were leaving the area. A few minutes later, a private citizen in the same vicinity contacted the Vermilion Parish SO and reported that he heard what sounded like three gunshots. Responding deputies arrived at the scene to find the off-duty deputy lying in the street with three wounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun to his rear upper torso/back and front lower torso/stomach. The responding officers reported that the deputy’s truck, trailer, and mower were missing from the scene and that a vehicle was apparently stuck in a ditch nearby. The victim deputy was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries to the front lower torso/stomach. The same day, a 20-year-old suspect was arrested in Kaplan and was charged with First-Degree Murder, Simple Burglary, Unauthorized Use of a Movable, and Violation of Probation/Parole. He was on parole at the time of the incident and had a prior criminal record that included arrests for police assault and drug violations. On June 24, a 19-year-old man appeared at the Abbeville Police Department to provide a statement regarding why his car was found in the ditch.

The detective, who had nearly 9 years of law enforcement experience, was assigned to guard the door-breaching team and to enter the residence first with his weapon. As the warrant team approached the residence, the detective positioned himself to the right of the front door. Entry officers knocked on the door, stated their official identity, and announced their intentions. When the occupant of the dwelling did not respond after a reasonable amount of time, the officers rammed the outer security door and began to breach the inner door. Someone inside the dwelling began shooting at the officers through the door and walls. The detective, who was wearing body armor at the time of the attack, was wounded in the chest when a bullet from a .357-caliber revolver entered through the right armhole of the vest. He was carried by officers to safety where he received initial medical aid and then was transported to a local medical center. While some of the officers exchanged gunfire with the alleged assailant, deputies entered the residence with a K-9 police dog and arrested two men. One suspect, a 45-year-old male who was a known narcotics dealer and who had an extensive history of arrests for drug- and alcohol-related offenses, was charged with First-Degree Murder and Convicted Felon in Possession of a Handgun. The officers subsequently determined that the second man was not an offender but was only a witness who was present in the residence at the time of the incident.

Two suspects, who were reportedly armed, had already begun to flee from the scene of the incident. A backup officer arrived to provide assistance, and the two officers began foot pursuit through a residential area. The first officer apparently observed one of the suspects hiding in tall brush.

From a distance of 11 to 20 feet, the suspect fired several rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer multiple times. Other officers arrived and attempted to rescue the victim officer but were repelled by additional fire from the suspect. When the officers returned fire, the 18-year-old suspect, whose prior rap sheet included weapons violations, violent crime, and juvenile conviction, surrendered. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated for a bullet wound to the lower leg and for wounds that proved to be fatal to the neck and throat area.

All three victim corporals were veteran law enforcement officers who were wearing protective body armor at the time of the incident. Upon arrival, the first corporal, who was 32 years of age and had 10 years of law enforcement experience, spoke with the woman in front of the residence. The woman reported that her husband was intoxicated and that he had assaulted her. She told the corporal that she believed there were firearms locked in a vehicle inside the closed garage, but she did not know if her husband had the keys to the vehicle. The officer attempted to contact the man at the front door, but there was no response. The suspect’s wife gave the officers permission to enter through the back door of the residence. As the first corporal entered the door, he was struck in the jaw with a round from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. He managed to return three rounds from his service weapon and then staggered out of the rear door of the residence. In the exchange of gunfire, a second corporal, who was 48 years of age with over 22 years of law enforcement experience, attempted to take cover against the rear exterior of the home. However, the offender leaned out of a window and fired, striking the corporal’s left arm. As the corporal fell to the ground, the man shot another round into the top right of the victim officer’s head, fatally wounding him. The corporal died at the scene. Additional responding officers arrived and were directed to the rear of the residence by the first victim corporal, who was still standing. As the assisting officers surrounded the residence, the man fired another round of shots from the window, striking a third corporal in the face. The third victim corporal, who was 30 years of age and had nearly 10 years of law enforcement experience, was killed instantly. Three officers, who were attempting to help the downed corporal, exchanged gunfire with the offender. After a 4-hour standoff the 58-year-old suspect, who had a criminal history including violent crime and weapons violations, was taken into custody. The first victim corporal was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to an area medical center where he died 4 days later as a result of his injuries.

law enforcement experience, and the 20-year-old patrol officer, who been on the job for 1 month, were both wearing body armor when they stopped a man driving a vehicle that had been reported stolen by a law enforcement agency in Texas. The father of the man the officers had stopped was traveling with him in a second vehicle, a truck. The father pulled in at the scene of the traffic stop and fired on both officers with a .38-caliber handgun. One of the officers returned fire and struck the suspect in the leg. The suspect’s son fled the scene in the truck his father had been driving. During the encounter, both officers received lacerations to their heads—the lieutenant to the rear of his head and the patrol officer to the front of his head. The patrol officer was also struck in the rear lower torso/back, but the officer’s protective vest prevented a potentially lethal injury. The suspect’s son later abandoned the truck and continued to flee on foot, but officers located him in nearby woods and apprehended him around 5:40 p.m. It was later determined that the 54-year-old suspect who shot the officers had traveled with his son from Texas to West Virginia. Officers investigating the incident found two deceased adult bodies, a male and a female, concealed under a mattress in the back of the truck, along with two dead dogs and other related evidence. The truck was registered in North Carolina to the male murder victim. Both murder victims had been reported as missing persons in North Carolina. Allegedly, the suspect killed the victims at their home in North Carolina, burned the couple’s home, and stole their truck. The suspect was charged with two counts of First-Degree Murder, two counts of Attempted Murder, and two counts of Malicious Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer. The suspect had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, a drug law violation, and a weapons violation. He was on conditional release at the time of the incidents.

When the sergeant arrived at the residence, the subject’s sister reported the subject had taken approximately15 antidepressant pills and had been texting his friends indicating he wanted to kill himself. She forwarded those messages to the sergeant. Another female in the residence led the sergeant upstairs to the subject’s bedroom. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, knocked on the door and called out the subject’s name, but no one answered. The woman opened the door and gave the sergeant permission to enter the bedroom. Since the subject, who outweighed the sergeant by around 70 pounds, was under the influence of antidepressant pills and appeared to be in a hopeless frame of mind, the sergeant decided to wait for backup officers to arrive before engaging him. The subject told the sergeant that he wanted to kill himself because of “all the bad going on around him.” The sergeant tried to convince the subject to leave the bedroom, but the subject refused and said that he would not cooperate with medical personnel. Based upon the statements the subject had made to his sister and friends, the sergeant determined that the subject was a threat to himself and decided to have him involuntarily committed to a hospital. Once backup arrived, the sergeant pulled slightly on the subject’s legs, saying “Let’s go,” as the subject lay on his bed. Simultaneously, a backup officer tried to pull the subject up by his arm. At this point, the subject sat up quickly and stabbed the sergeant in the right inner forearm with a pair of scissors. The sergeant pulled the subject off the bed and onto the floor, and the backup officer positioned himself on the subject’s back in an effort to subdue him; however, the subject refused to relinquish the scissors. The sergeant deployed an electronic control device into the subject’s upper right thigh and again in the subject’s right side. The subject dropped the scissors, and the backup officer handcuffed him. Medical personnel evaluated the subject and transported him to a local medical center.

The weapon was jammed, and investigators believe that at the time she was slain, the victim deputy was attempting to draw her weapon.

Responding officers found the victim deputy, who was wearing body armor, on the ground near the rear of his vehicle. He had been shot in the arms/hands and fatally in the head at close range with his service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, which was found at the scene.

The deputy, with almost 6 years of law enforcement experience, was driving his patrol vehicle when the driver of a truck that had pulled in behind him at an intersection accelerated into oncoming traffic and passed the marked patrol vehicle. The driver of the truck pulled alongside the vehicle in front of the deputy and turned sharply into the vehicle, forcing it to the curb. The veteran deputy, who was wearing body armor, pulled his patrol vehicle over between the two vehicles, activated his lights, and began to report the accident over his radio. His report stopped in midsentence as the driver of the truck exited his vehicle and began shooting a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the deputy as he sat in his patrol vehicle. The shooter fired a total of 11 rounds, striking the deputy in the front of the head, as well as the hood and windshield of the deputy’s vehicle and a nearby house. Before suffering the fatal wound, the deputy drew his weapon, and fired one round at the suspect but missed. It was subsequently learned that the shooter was the estranged husband of the woman driving the other vehicle, and that she had a restraining order against him. After shooting the deputy, the man walked to the car in which the woman was now cowering on the floor, and he began shouting at her to look at him.

The employee also reported the furniture in the room appeared to be damaged. When the second officer arrived on the scene, the officers made contact with the couple.

At the first officer’s request, they secured their pit bulls. The woman went inside the motel room with the first officer, and the man stayed outside with the second officer. After surveying the damage to the motel room, the officer emerged and indicated the couple should be placed under arrest. The first officer then walked behind the man and attempted to handcuff him. The man began to pull away, and the second officer grabbed the man’s left arm to try to pull the arm behind his back so he could be handcuffed. The man tried to grab the first officer’s electronic control device (ECD), but the officer took it and ordered the man to the ground. The man did not comply with the officer’s order, so the officer deployed the ECD. The man cried out and began running away. The second officer, who was wearing body armor, ran after the suspect and radioed dispatch, advising he was chasing a suspect. The chase led to a narrow area between the back of a building and a retaining wall, where the suspect stopped and fired two rounds at the second officer from a .357-caliber semiautomatic handgun, fatally striking him in the neck/throat.

Based upon the statements the subject had made to his sister and friends, the sergeant determined that the subject was a threat to himself and decided to have him involuntarily committed to a hospital. Once backup arrived, the sergeant pulled slightly on the subject’s legs, saying “Let’s go,” as the subject lay on his bed. Simultaneously, a backup officer tried to pull the subject up by his arm. At this point, the subject sat up quickly and stabbed the sergeant in the right inner forearm with a pair of scissors. The sergeant pulled the subject off the bed and onto the floor, and the backup officer positioned himself on the subject’s back in an effort to subdue him; however, the subject refused to relinquish the scissors. The sergeant deployed an electronic control device into the subject’s upper right thigh and again in the subject’s right side. The subject dropped the scissors, and the backup officer handcuffed him. Medical personnel evaluated the subject and transported him to a local medical center. Medical personnel also evaluated and treated the sergeant’s wound at the scene; the sergeant later sought additional treatment at an emergency care facility. After the 20- year-old subject was released from the medical center later that day, officers arrested him and charged him with Aggravated Assault and Interference with a Peace Officer. The sergeant has since recovered from his injury and returned to duty.", "id.num": 1193}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.764633Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:13:56.418339Z", "inner_id": 116, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97056987, "annotations": [{"id": 32815522, "completed_by": {"id": 19178, "email": "spencerdotson@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "aTF-9p466o", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 16, "text": "police officer", "start": 2, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "gPx30xTgs_", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 58, "text": "San Bernardino Police Department", "start": 26, "labels": ["Department"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "yQz1H9TmSB", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 173, "text": "2 a.m.", "start": 167, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "yFyf1l6--W", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 186, "text": "August 22", "start": 177, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "aEdBxK3hOy", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 203, "text": "31-year-old", "start": 192, "labels": ["Age"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "KY0zbZbitp", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 263, "text": "6 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 226, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "QQgekglcEF", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 953, "text": ".38-caliber revolver", "start": 933, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "h7TJ4DXvHy", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1155, "text": "7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle", "start": 1125, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "lStBAyKuh-", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1603, "text": "narcotics", "start": 1594, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "4PMyd4C9kp", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Assignment", "Investigation"], ["Situation", "Encounter"], ["Suspect", "Killed"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-16T21:12:24.183285Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:15:03.966281Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-16T21:10:48.784659Z", "lead_time": 170.534, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "fb7e9a9a-701a-421b-9f19-9e558e404784", "import_id": null, "last_action": "updated", "task": 97056987, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19178}, {"id": 32867342, "completed_by": {"id": 19168, "email": "lillianellis@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "CGYiM8-aIi", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "xlUglILOyZ", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 978, "text": "fficers approached the group, one individual began to move away.

In an attempt to pull him over for the violation, the officer pulled along the passenger side of the suspect’s vehicle. At the same time, the suspect fired at least 5 shots through the passenger-side open window with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The officers returned fire; however, they did not hit the suspect.

The victim officer initially did not realize he was shot, and he continued driving in pursuit of the suspect’s vehicle. The suspect drove down the garage ramp of an apartment building, and the door of the garage closed behind him. The victim officer exited his vehicle and then realized he had been shot. He was rushed to a local hospital where he spent several hours in surgery. Later that day, the officer succumbed to the single gunshot wound that had grazed his heart. In the meantime, investigating officers located the alleged shooter’s vehicle in the parking garage into which he had driven. A check of the vehicle’s registration led them to an individual who told the officers that he recently had sold the car to a man. They traced the man to his girlfriend’s apartment, where he eventually surrendered to the officers. They found the weapon used in the murder of the officer in the courtyard behind the girlfriend’s apartment building, where the alleged shooter had apparently thrown it.

Throughout the night, two individuals allegedly had been posing as police officers and had committed a string of armed robberies and carjackings. They had also allegedly shot some of their victims. Recent radio communication conveyed that two troopers had spotted a vehicle matching the description of one of the carjacked vehicles, and the occupants matched the descriptions of the armed suspects. Upon seeing the troopers, the suspects abruptly pulled over and fled on foot. In response, at least 13 MSP troopers, an MSP K-9, and several Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers established a three-block perimeter in tLhawe EnnefoigrchembeonrthOoffoicder.sMKiSllePd aannddADssPauDlteud nits coordinated effoUrt.sS.toD erpeasrttrmicetntt roafffJiucs,ticcaen—vFaesdesratlreBuertesauinofpInavierssti,gaatniodn clear vacant buildings in groups of four. After the K-9 lost the track in a vacant lot, an abandoned house nearby was determined to be a likely hideaway. Four troopers and the K-9 entered the structure and cleared the ground floor. However, when they began to clear the second level, two of the troopers came under fire. One of the troopers, a 13-year veteran of law enforcement who was wearing body armor, saw a flash from a bedroom facing the stairwell and then realized that he had been hit in the lower left leg. Both the 37-year-old victim trooper and his partner returned fire, took cover, and then established verbal contact with each other. The second trooper yelled for the subject to show his hands and drop his weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, but the subject did not comply. Upon hearing the exchange of gunfire and radio communications, MSP troopers and DPD officers who were at area perimeter points tightened the perimeter to the outside of the residence. One trooper with an M-4 rifle and two DPD officers entered and provided cover at the top of the stairwell for the wounded trooper and his partner. However, as the injured trooper and his partner moved toward the stairwell, a shot came from the bedroom where the subject was hiding. The troopers and officers returned fire, but the wounded trooper and his partner were forced to retreat back to the room. Covering officers continued to announce their presence and demand that the subject surrender. Meanwhile, officers outside observed a second subject climb out of an upstairs window and jump from a lower roof onto the ground; MSP troopers and DPD officers immediately took him into custody. Inside, law enforcement heard a weak voice come from the bedroom where the subject was hiding. When troopers again demanded his surrender, two gloved hands appeared, but the subject’s full body was not visible. The trooper and officers on the stairs entered the room under the cover of the trooper with the M-4 rifle and, after a brief struggle, secured the subject. Led by his partner, the victim trooper limped down the stairs, and then was carried by his partner to an emergency medical services unit that transported him to a local hospital. At the abandoned house, the 38-year-old subject from the upstairs and the 36-year-old subject who had been apprehended outside, both of whom had prior convictions for violent crime and weapons violations, were arrested and charged with Armed Robbery, Carjacking, Assault with Intent to Murder, Felon in Possession of a Firearm, and Weapon Felony Firearm. Additional charges for the 38-year-old were Weapon Felony Firearm; those for the 36-year-old were Conspiracy to Resist Arrest, Resisting and Obstructing (R & O) Causing Severe Impairment, R & O Causing Injury, eight counts of R & O, and Second-Degree Felony Firearm.

Not knowing that a subject had arrived and parked his vehicle out of the agents’ view, the agents heard a knock at the door. The subject then opened the door with a firearm in his hand and saw the agents, who were in plain clothes but wearing badges and body armor outside their clothes with visible law enforcement markings. He fired multiple rounds from a 9 mm automatic handgun, which was later discovered to have been illegally modified from a semiautomatic to a fully- automatic handgun. The agent was struck in the rear upper torso and fatally wounded by a round to his shoulder (upper torso) area that entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his protective vest. Body cameras worn by the agents recorded the entire incident. The 41-year-old offender fled the scene, but agents apprehended him after a brief foot pursuit.

After trying to elicit a response from the man and receiving none, the officers called for backup and then forced open the bedroom door. The officer’s partner shone a flashlight around the room; she did not see anyone, but she heard a loud “popping” sound. The partner left the bedroom and then realized the officer was not behind her in the hallway. The partner turned and saw the man standing over the victim officer, shooting her in the chest at close range with a .50-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The partner retreated to a bathroom for cover and exchanged fire with the man. When the additional law enforcement units arrived, the responding officers shot and killed the 38-year-old perpetrator. The victim officer, who had been shot 14 times and received injuries to her torso, below her waist, and her arms and hands, was transported to a local medical center where she was pronounced dead.

Earlier, a man whose vehicle was being impounded in front of his residence confronted an officer who was completing the impound report and waiting for a tow truck. When the man engaged the officer in a verbal disagreement, the officer advised him to go back inside his residence. After the suspect went inside, the officer observed that a baggie appearing to contain methamphetamine had fallen out of the man’s pocket and was lying on the ground. The officer then advised the dispatcher to send additional officers. When additional officers arrived, the man came out of his residence and began yelling at them. The officers, one of whom was the 47-year-old veteran officer, went to speak to the man and arrest him for the suspected narcotics which had fallen from his pocket. However, the man ran into his residence and officers followed. As the officers attempted to arrest him, he resisted and produced a kitchen knife. A struggle ensued, during which the suspect cut the veteran officer on his gloved hand (the knife penetrated the glove). Another officer used an electronic control weapon to subdue the suspect, and the suspect was taken into custody. The 32-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record and was under the influence of narcotics at the time of incident, was arrested and charged with Second-Degree Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, Use of Weapon to Commit a Felony, and Possession of a Controlled Substance.

Hours earlier a man had made a 911 call indicating that he had shot at least three family members and did not want to kill more. Units responded, and staff communicating with the residence via the 911 line heard mumbling sounds that may have been a victim in peril in the background. The LAPD SWAT team was requested, and when the members arrived at the scene, an emergency rescue team was formed to make entry through the front door. The suspect fired shots from a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the SWAT team as they attempted to make entry. A 51-yearold police officer with 27 years of law enforcement experience was fatally shot in the front of the head. Another 51-year-old officer with nearly 26 years of law enforcement experience was seriously injured when he was shot in the front of the head. Both victim officers were wearing protective body armor. During the hours following the initial attempt to enter the residence, there were multiple attempts to encourage the suspect to surrender. The confrontation between the 20-year-old suspect and the officers continued over the next several hours until the suspect was justifiably killed by an officer. The man had a prior criminal record including weapons violations and was a known user of narcotics.

At 6:42 a.m., another officer was dispatched to a local grocery store following a report of a theft of coffee. The dispatcher provided the subject’s name and description of the vehicle, which was parked in front of the store. The officer knew the subject from previous law enforcement contacts and was aware from recent morning briefings that law enforcement had banned the subject from the store premises. Upon his arrival at the store, the officer observed the subject standing next to his vehicle. When the subject saw the officer, he got into his vehicle and locked all the doors. A store employee pointed at the subject and identified him as the man who had stolen coffee. The officer approached the subject’s vehicle and asked him to open the window; the subject rolled the window down about an inch. The officer noticed a half-full mug of steaming coffee in the passenger seat. When the officer asked why the subject had stolen the coffee, he replied, “Because I can.” The subject admitted he had been asked to leave the property earlier the same morning. When the officer informed the subject he was trespassing, he replied with phrases such as “just shoot me then,” “suicide by cop,” and “pull the trigger.” The subject rolled up the window and turned up the volume of the radio. The officer asked the subject to exit the vehicle several times, but he refused. Two officers arrived to assist, and the original responding officer advised them of the situation and requested help to arrest the subject. The 51-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, told the subject that he was under arrest and ordered him to exit his vehicle several times, but the subject did not comply. The officers observed the subject pretending to shave his beard with a knife and then actually cutting his neck. Because the subject was a danger to himself, the 51-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, broke the front passenger side window, opened the door, and entered through it. The second assisting officer got into the car through the same door and unsuccessfully attempted to unlock the driver’s side door. Meanwhile, the 51-year-old officer wrestled the subject for the knife and repeatedly ordered him to drop the weapon. The original responding officer went to the passenger side and fired his electronic control device, which struck the offender in the upper right shoulder but had little effect. The second assisting officer unlocked the driver’s side door, so the original responding officer went back to that side of the vehicle, removed the subject from the car, and placed him in handcuffs. The subject had three 2-inch cuts on his left hand and abrasions on the right side of his neck, so the officers requested medical transport for him. During the struggle, the 51-year-old officer suffered a 1-inch cut on his left thumb. He was transported to a local hospital where he received six stitches and was released. The injured officer has since returned to duty. The 45-year-old offender was charged with Trespassing, Shoplifting, Obstruct/Resist Executive Officer, and Resisting Arrest. He had a criminal history that resulted in him being incarcerated in a penal institution.", "id.num": 463}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:38:53.765105Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:28:36.068105Z", "inner_id": 130, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58510, "updated_by": 19178, "comment_authors": []}]
