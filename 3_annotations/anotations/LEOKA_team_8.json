sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm. His criminal history included arrests for assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest, a weapons violation, and a drug law violation.

When the police officer, who was wearing body armor, approached the woman, a struggle ensued, and both fell to the ground. During the struggle, the woman grabbed the police officer’s .38-caliber revolver and shot him in the front of the head. She then used the same gun to shoot at responding officers. Those officers returned fire, hitting and wounding the woman. The victim police officer was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

"On February 15, at 11:34 a.m., a 56-year-old lieutenant with the Chattahoochee Hills Police Department (CHPD) was shot to death in an unprovoked attack. The lieutenant, a 30-year veteran of law enforcement, was on patrol in the city. Around noon, a county dispatcher received a telephone call from a passerby who had come upon the lieutenant’s patrol vehicle and discovered the lieutenant inside. Responding units arrived at the scene and found the patrol car still running and the back window shattered. Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon. A caller indicated that the suspect was in the area where the lieutenant had been shot and that the weapon used in the slaying had originally been purchased as a non-automatic weapon but had been altered by the alleged shooter to be “fully automatic.” When the tipster spoke with the ATF agent, the individual indicated that the alleged shooter had said that when he shot the lieutenant, the weapon was on “full auto.” On February 17, a 44-year-old man was arrested for the shooting and charged with Murder, Aggravated Assault, and Possession of a Firearm. The man, who was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record that included violent crime and weapons violations. He also was acquainted with the victim lieutenant through a law enforcement relationship.", "id.num": 832}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.823789Z", "updated_at":

situation while attempting to serve First-Degree Murder warrants in Kinston. The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor. Four suspects, aged 26-, 18-, 17-, and 16-years-old, were subsequently arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The 18-year-old was also charged with a second count of First-Degree Murder. Each suspect, with the exception of the 16-year-old, had prior arrests.", "id.num": 1066}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.823822Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-13T23:15:21.594413Z",

Assigned to the Narcotics Bureau at the time of the incident, the officer was on surveillance duty, wearing a sweatshirt with an agency logo, when at midnight, he stopped at a Milwaukee convenience store. After leaving the store, he was confronted in the parking lot by two men who had allegedly watched him enter the store and viewed him as a profitable robbery mark. The two men approached the agent, and one of them pointed a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at him as the other patted him down for weapons. The agent identified himself as a police officer, and the perpetrators discovered the agent’s service weapon. The man holding the handgun shot the agent twice at close range, striking him once in the abdomen, before the two subjects fled the scene. The agent was taken to a local hospital where he died from his wounds seven days later. Investigators apprehended the perpetrators on November 9. The 26-year-old offender who had fired the gun was charged with First-Degree Intentional Homicide, Attempted Robbery, and Possession of a Firearm by a Felon. A known drug dealer, he had a criminal record that included convictions for violent crimes, drugs, and weapons violations.

The subject, the probation officer, and the police officer were conversing in front of the apartment complex when the subject produced a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and began shooting the police officer. The victim officer was wounded in the upper and lower torso/back despite his body armor, in the arms/hands, and in the rear of the head. After mortally wounding the officer, the subject stole the officer’s service weapon and fled the scene in the officer’s police cruiser. Responding officers caught up with the subject when he crashed the cruiser less than a mile away from the shooting. The 20-year-old subject exited the vehicle to flee on foot but was confronted by the officers. He pointed the firearm at officers who responded with gunfire. The subject was critically wounded in the head and taken to a nearby hospital. The victim officer was also transported to the hospital where he died from the rear head wound in the early morning hours of October 29.", "id.num": 650}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia. The suspect had a prior criminal record and was found to be under the influence of alcohol and narcotics at the time of the incident. Just before 1 a.m. on February 23, a 44-year-old trooper with the Washington State Patrol, Bremerton, requested information on a vehicle during a traffic stop in Gorst. When dispatchers could not make further contact with the trooper, a deputy sheriff was sent to investigate and found the veteran trooper, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience and who was wearing body armor, along the roadside with a single gunshot wound to the front of his head from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The victim trooper was transported to a nearby hospital and confirmed dead. About four hours after the shooting, the vehicle in question was found abandoned a few miles from the scene. Investigators learned the owner of the abandoned vehicle had obtained a ride to a friend’s property in a nearby town. As a SWAT team surrounded the friend’s property a gunshot was heard coming from a trailer. A female exited the trailer and told the SWAT team the 28-year-old suspect had shot himself. The female also indicated the suspect had said he shot “a cop.” The suspect was taken to a nearby hospital and later died of his self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was a known drug dealer with a prior criminal record, which included drug violations, violent crime, and police assault. The suspect was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.", "id.num": 526}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.823954Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-13T23:36:15.028245Z",

At 3 a.m., as the officers were joining the search, the suspect began firing a .357-caliber revolver in their direction. In the exchange of gunfire that followed, the victim officer, a veteran with nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience, managed to return 3 shots before he was struck once in his upper torso. The bullet entered between the side panels of his body armor, immediately killing him.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail. The male prisoner exited the back of the van and immediately began assaulting the 43-year-old deputy, a 16-year law enforcement veteran, with a homemade cutting instrument, cutting the deputy’s head, neck, arms/hands, and front legs/feet. With the deputy down, the suspect ran to the driver’s seat of the van. The injured deputy, who was wearing body armor, recovered and entered the van through the front passenger’s side door. The 59-year-old deputy, who was also wearing body armor, ran to the driver’s side of the van to attempt to apprehend the suspect. During the struggle, the suspect gained possession of one of the deputy’s service weapons, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The suspect fatally shot the injured 43-year-old deputy in the side of the head with the service weapon. The suspect then shot the 59-year-old deputy in the front lower torso/abdomen below his protective vest and took possession of the other deputy’s service weapon. The injured 59-year-old deputy fell to the ground outside the van. The suspect exited the van and took the van keys and extra ammunition from the 59-year-old deputy. The suspect got back in the van, started it with the stolen keys, and fled the scene by ramming the closed sally port door. At 10:57 a.m., the suspect pulled up behind two motorists in a pickup truck at an intersection. The truck driver noticed the suspect exiting the van dressed in a yellow jumpsuit carrying a firearm and realized the man was an escaped prisoner. As the suspect attempted to open the driver’s side door of the truck, the truck driver tried to drive away, but the suspect fired one round through the truck’s window, striking the driver in the neck. The injured motorist continued driving until he drove into a ditch north of the intersection. The suspect returned to the van and fled. A few minutes later, the suspect drove up behind another vehicle stopped at a stop sign. The suspect drove past the vehicle and parked in front of it in the middle of an intersection. The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody. He had a criminal history that included murder charges. The deputies were transported to a local hospital where the 43-year-old deputy was pronounced dead. The 59-year-old deputy was treated for severe injuries. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured deputy had not returned to duty.", "id.num": 40}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824021Z", "updated_at":

The veteran deputy parked his patrol vehicle and, as he walked in front of the vehicle towards the man, the man fired one round from a .223-caliber bolt-action rifle from a distance of more than 50 feet. The round struck the deputy in the rear lower torso/back. The injured deputy ran east from the scene while calling for backup on his portable radio. Witnesses saw the 42-year-old offender follow the deputy for a short distance before returning to the residence. The deputy was able to tell emergency medical personnel and responding officers the offender’s name before he succumbed to his wound. The officers entered the offender’s residence, but exited when the offender began firing his weapon. The offender remained barricaded in the residence until late the next morning when he surrendered to SWAT officers after an unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide.

injuries suffered in a shooting on April 25, 1999. Around 7:30 in the evening of the incident, the trooper, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a report of a woman’s body found in a local cemetery. The trooper, along with other troopers and the sheriff and deputies from the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department, arrived at the cemetery and found the body with a fatal gunshot wound to the head. As the officers were securing the scene, a man approached them. When questioned, he identified himself as the dead woman’s husband and told officers he had shot her and was going to kill himself as well. At that time, officers observed that the 52-year-old suspect was hiding a .357 Magnum revolver behind his back and took cover. The suspect raised the gun but did not threaten the officers. The trooper and the sheriff began to negotiate with the suspect in an attempt to talk him into putting down his weapon. During the discussion, the trooper made an attempt to disarm the man by throwing a flashlight against his chest. The trooper and the sheriff then rushed the man, and as he fell backwards, the man fired three times hitting the sheriff in the shoulder and striking the trooper in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fatally shot himself in the head. Emergency medical technicians immediately responded to the scene and treated both the trooper and the sheriff. The victim trooper, who suffered severe blood loss and spinal cord injury from his neck wound, was transported to an area hospital and later admitted to a trauma center where he spent 8 months. The trooper’s injuries resulted in his paralysis from the neck down and ultimately led to his death nearly 7 years after the incident.", "id.num": 412}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Sheriff’s Office was killed, and three additional law enforcement officers were injured, while attempting to restrain and control a suspect during an investigative activity shortly before 4 p.m. on February 5 in Colorado Springs. The deputy, an 11-year veteran of law enforcement, was part of a multiagency motor vehicle theft task force. Earlier that afternoon, the task force was notified of a stolen vehicle that had been spotted in several areas throughout El Paso County. Task force members found the vehicle at an apartment complex, even though the suspect stopped at several locations and spray painted it in an attempt to disguise it. Members of the task force identified the suspect alone in the parking lot. The 34-year-old deputy and a 29-year-old deputy approached the suspect as he walked to the stolen vehicle. The two deputies grabbed the suspect and attempted to take him into custody. The suspect pulled out a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shot the 29-year-old deputy once in the front lower torso/abdomen below his body armor. The suspect wrestled with the 34-year-old deputy and continued firing his weapon, fatally striking him in the rear upper torso/back and the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. A 45-year-old sergeant with the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office and a 44-year-old detective with the Colorado Springs Police Department, both members of the task force and also wearing body armor, exchanged gunfire with the suspect. Both the sergeant and detective were injured. Despite his injuries, the detective returned gunfire striking the 19-year-old suspect in the front upper torso/chest, justifiably killing him. The suspect had previous arrests for a drug law violation and theft and was a known or suspected gang member. The sergeant, a 16-year veteran of law enforcement, recovered from minor injuries to his rear below the waist/buttocks and rear legs and has returned to duty. The 29-year-old deputy, an 8-year veteran of law enforcement, suffered severe wounds to the front lower torso/abdomen. The detective, a 21-year veteran of law enforcement, sustained severe injuries to the front below waist/groin area. Neither the 29-year-old deputy nor the detective has returned to duty. A bystander was also struck and paralyzed by a round fired by the suspect.", "id.num": 26}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824143Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-14T18:50:32.749208Z",

autumn night in the Midwest, an officer, who had 24 years of law enforcement experience, was working an overtime detail when he observed a vehicle being driven in a reckless manner. The officer followed the vehicle to a residential area, but the driver eluded him. While attempting to locate the vehicle, the officer received  a radio assignment to assist another officer with a person suspected of driving under the influence. As the officer was turning around, he saw the vehicle he had been pursuing now parked in the middle of the street. The officer activated his emergency lights, pulled behind the suspect vehicle, and noticed the driver's side door was slightly ajar. The officer did not have time to notify dispatch of his location before the offender left his vehicle and advanced on the officer while firing multiple rounds from his 9 mm semiautomatic firearm. Five rounds struck the officer as he was exiting his patrol vehicle. Two of the rounds struck him in the legs, and one round hit him in the center of his body but was stopped by his protective vest; the last two rounds hit him in the feet. The officer drew his service weapon and returned fire, causing the offender to retreat to his vehicle. None of the officer's rounds struck the offender. Accompanied by four other people, the offender fled in his vehicle. He drove to another state and turned himself in the same day. The 25-year-old offender was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The officer recovered from his injuries and returned to full duty.", "id.num": 1234}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824173Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-14T18:56:47.571545Z", "inner_id":

was killed while investigating a call concerning suspicious persons or circumstances. The veteran officer, who had 21 years of law enforcement experience, was interviewing two suspects and was being assisted by a second police officer, who had nearly 4½ years of experience. The second officer had responded as backup when he heard the call from dispatch. The investigating officer had subdued one of the suspects and was attempting to search him as she instructed the second suspect to place his hands on the hood of the vehicle. The assisting officer had entered his patrol car and was calling dispatch with the suspects’ vehicle information. The second suspect, who was apparently armed with a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun, shot the investigating officer fatally in her neck/throat and then ran to the assisting officer’s vehicle and shot multiple rounds into the car. The assisting officer, who was wearing body armor, was wounded in his rear lower torso/back and his leg. The investigating officer, who was also wearing body armor at the time of the shooting, was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead later that day. The 28-year-old assisting officer underwent surgery and was expected to make a full recovery. The alleged shooter, a 21-year-old man with a prior criminal record and who was on probation at the time of the incident, fled the scene. He was located the next day in Birmingham at a friend’s residence and was arrested without incident by officers from a multiagency task force. The arrestee was charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer and Attempted Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.", "id.num": 943}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824203Z",

{"text": "At 10:37 p.m. on June 23, a deputy sheriff with the Comal County Sheriff’s Office was shot while handling a person with a mental illness in Bulverde. The deputy, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a residence where a man reportedly had a firearm and was suicidal. The caller was a family member and said he believed the man intended to attempt “suicide by cop.” When the 35-year-old deputy, along with three officers from the Bulverde Police Department (BPD), pulled up to the residence, they saw a man walking around with a firearm in his hand. The deputy and officers drew their weapons and ordered the man several times to put down the weapon, telling him they were there to help. The man walked into the street in front of the deputy’s patrol unit and began to walk toward the vehicle with the firearm in his hands. He then raised his arms and fired the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the officers. The deputy returned fire with his rifle. One round from the assailant’s weapon struck the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the front lower torso/stomach below his body armor. The victim deputy took cover at the back of his patrol unit, and he and responding BPD officers continued to return fire, striking the suspect several times. The victim deputy was taken by ambulance, then by helicopter, to a hospital for treatment. The deputy recovered from his injuries and has since returned to duty. The 22-year-old suspect, who also was taken to a hospital, was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer. Just before 7 p.m. on January 2, a 49-year-old sergeant with the Denton Police Department was assaulted while handling a person with a mental illness. The 20-year veteran sergeant was one of three officers who were dispatched to a local hotel to deal with a 911 caller who was incoherent and agitated, using methamphetamine, and armed with a knife which had a blade approximately 3 to 4 inches long. The caller repeatedly told dispatchers he had “committed crimes and hurt people.” The officers, who obtained a room key from management, spent some time speaking with the subject and trying to get him to open the door. A fourth officer, who was certified to use an electronic control weapon (ECW) arrived on the scene. When all attempts to get the man to come out of the room failed, the officers prepared to use the master key and a two-prong fork tool to disable the swing arm deadbolt lock. The door was unlocked, and the sergeant, who was wearing body armor, was operating the two-prong fork tool on the deadbolt when the subject thrust the knife through the narrow opening, striking the sergeant in the arms/hands. The fourth officer deployed the ECW on the suspect’s hand, and though only one prong hit, it was enough to cause the suspect to drop the knife. The officers forced the door open, and a second burst from the ECW made contact with the suspect’s chest. Officers were able to subdue and handcuff him. The 38-year-old suspect was taken to the city jail where he was placed in a restraint chair and incarcerated. The suspect, who had no reported prior criminal history, said he had been doing methamphetamine since the day before. The injured sergeant returned to duty after this incident.", "id.num": 663}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824269Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-17T21:54:44.535693Z", "inner_id": 18,

shortly before 7 a.m. on December 26 while investigating a suspicious person in Devol. A newspaper delivery person notified the 35-year-old officer at his residence of an unconscious individual in a vehicle on a rural road. The officer, with nearly 7 years of law enforcement experience, was not scheduled to go on duty until later in the day, but he donned his uniform and went to investigate the matter. At 6:42 a.m., the trooper radioed dispatchers that he was investigating a vehicle with a male inside and that he could not see the vehicle’s registration tag. As the trooper approached the vehicle, he saw chemicals commonly used to produce drugs. When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.", "id.num": 580}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect.

"f3d2399a-data8.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 55.96799323361823, "data": {"text": "A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.", "id.num": 290}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was treated at a nearby hospital, but died from the wound to his upper back from a round that entered through the armhole of his vest. The offender was also treated for his injuries and later charged with Aggravated Murder, Having a Weapon While Under Disability, and Carrying a Concealed Weapon. The offender was known to police and had a prior criminal history including violent crime, murder, drug violations, police assault, and weapons violations. The night of the shooting, the offender was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and the arresting officers found a bag of marijuana in his possession.", "id.num": 277}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects. The 38-year-old man who allegedly shot the victim officer was charged with Murder, Possession of a Firearm, Firing Weapon, and Carjacking. He was under the influence of narcotics and on probation at the time of the incidents and had a prior criminal record which included a murder.

The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.", "id.num": 721}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824583Z", "updated_at":

vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The suspect was subsequently found unconscious in his jail cell and later died. The cause of death had not been determined at the time of this report.", "id.num": 624}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824613Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T18:16:02.309417Z",

department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31. The deceased offender was later found to have marijuana and cocaine in a bag tied to his belt and concealed in his clothes. Friends of the suspect reported he had told them he did not want to go back to prison and would “do what he had to do to stay out.” The suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, police assault, weapons violations, and drug violations, had been convicted previously. The suspect was also a registered sex offender.", "id.num": 547}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824646Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T19:20:18.002037Z", "inner_id": 30,

As the deputy spoke to the driver of the vehicle, he began to suspect the driver had provided him with a false name. In the process of investigating his suspicion, the deputy, who was wearing body armor and a body camera that was recording the interaction, made multiple trips between his marked patrol unit and the stopped vehicle to speak to the driver. The deputy was unaware that the driver was wanted for aggravated assault. On the deputy’s final trip to his patrol unit, the suspect exited his vehicle and approached the deputy from behind. When he was 5 feet from the deputy, he fired one round from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, which struck the deputy in the rear of his head. The suspect returned to his vehicle and fled; officers apprehended him a short distance from the scene. The victim deputy was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injury.

Department sustained severe injuries while checking on the welfare of a citizen in Lithonia. On July 31 beginning at 11:50 p.m., DeKalb County Communications received three phone calls in quick succession from the same number in Lithonia. The operator received little information from the calls but was able to discern that a female caller was being threatened by someone in the residence. Four minutes later, three officers responded to the address. Finding no lights on, the officers knocked on the door but received no answer. The officers looked around the outside of the residence but saw nothing alarming. The officers requested the dispatcher phone the complainant. When no one answered the call, the officers left the scene. At 12:29 a.m., another female called from a different phone number and reported that a family member called and awakened her, saying that during an argument, the caller’s son had shot his girlfriend. The caller immediately hung up. Three officers (two of whom were at the residence earlier) were dispatched to the scene. The operator called the complainant back and confirmed that the complainant’s son had shot his girlfriend, and that he was shooting at the officers who had already arrived at the residence. Body camera footage shows that as the three officers approached the front door of the residence, they encountered rifle fire from the subject inside. The 48-year-old officer, who had almost 3 years of law enforcement experience, was struck by three rounds, sustaining injuries below his body armor in front below his waist/groin area, his rear lower torso/back, and his arms/hands. As the officers took cover, the wounded officer discharged seven rounds from his service weapon in the direction of the gunfire, and another officer fired one round. None of the rounds struck the offender. The third officer radioed dispatch and alerted them that shots had been fired and an officer was injured. One of the assisting officers administered first aid to the wounded officer and escorted him to an emergency medical services unit. From there, the officer was transported to a local hospital where he underwent surgery. Meanwhile, the DeKalb County SWAT Team, Bomb Unit, K-9 Unit, Traffic Aggressive Control Team, and Aerial Support Unit responded to the scene. The SWAT Team entered the residence and found a deceased female with a chest wound in a second-floor bedroom. After the scene was cleared, a K-9 team began tracking the offender, locating his cell phone and a white shirt in the yard next door to the incident location. K-9 teams continued tracking the offender into the night and the next day with no results. On August 8 at 10:30 p.m., the Fugitive Unit, in conjunction with the K-9 Unit and U.S. Marshals, performed a vehicle traffic stop at a gas station in Lithonia and arrested the offender, who was a passenger in the vehicle, without incident. The 27-year-old offender was charged with Second-Degree Murder, three counts of Aggravated Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer, Damage to Property, Possession of a Firearm or Knife/Cutting Instrument During a Crime, Probation Violation, and Battery/Family Violence.

4:20 p.m. The 36-year old veteran lieutenant, who had 15 years of law enforcement experience, and the 20-year-old patrol officer, who been on the job for 1 month, were both wearing body armor when they stopped a man driving a vehicle that had been reported stolen by a law enforcement agency in Texas. The father of the man the officers had stopped was traveling with him in a second vehicle, a truck. The father pulled in at the scene of the traffic stop and fired on both officers with a .38-caliber handgun. One of the officers returned fire and struck the suspect in the leg. The suspect’s son fled the scene in the truck his father had been driving. During the encounter, both officers received lacerations to their heads--the lieutenant to the rear of his head and the patrol officer to the front of his head. The patrol officer was also struck in the rear lower torso/back, but the officer’s protective vest prevented a potentially lethal injury. The suspect’s son later abandoned the truck and continued to flee on foot, but officers located him in nearby woods and apprehended him around 5:40 p.m. It was later determined that the 54-year-old suspect who shot the officers had traveled with his son from Texas to West Virginia. Officers investigating the incident found two deceased adult bodies, a male and a female, concealed under a mattress in the back of the truck, along with two dead dogs and other related evidence. The truck was registered in North Carolina to the male murder victim. Both murder victims had been reported as missing persons in North Carolina. Allegedly, the suspect killed the victims at their home in North Carolina, burned the couple’s home, and stole their truck. The suspect was charged with two counts of First-Degree Murder, two counts of Attempted Murder, and two counts of Malicious Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer. The suspect had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, a drug law violation, and a weapons violation. He was on conditional release at the time of the incidents. Both victim officers were treated for their injuries and returned to duty.", "id.num": 847}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824772Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T19:26:01.753130Z",

At 11:16 a.m., the deputies exited their transport vehicle to access a fenced transport dock containing inmates. While handcuffed in front of his body and with his legs shackled, one of the inmates grabbed the 35-year-old deputy’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The deputy, a veteran with 6 years of law enforcement experience, contacted radio dispatch. The 44-year-old deputy, a veteran with 9 years of law enforcement experience, drew her service weapon. Using the deputy’s firearm, the inmate fired one round at the 35-year-old deputy, fatally striking him in the front of his head. The 44-year-old deputy fired at the inmate, striking him three times; the inmate fired one round at the 44-year-old deputy, fatally striking her in the rear of her head. Both deputies were wearing body armor. Other law enforcement officers responded to the scene and found the two deputies on the ground inside the transport dock’s fence; the wounded inmate was on his back next to the transport vehicle. Two firearms were on the ground between the wounded inmate and the 44-year-old deputy. Another inmate was standing on the raised portion of the dock with his hands raised. Officers detained the nearby inmate, secured the two firearms, and evacuated the wounded deputies and the wounded inmate to receive medical care. Both deputy sheriffs succumbed to their wounds later that day. The 30-year-old inmate was arrested and charged with two counts of Capital Murder and Aggravated Robbery. He was on probation at the time of the incident and had a criminal history including a charge for murder and a drug law violation.", "id.num": 148}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

The officer approached the men and identified himself. The burglar ran from the house, followed by both the officer and the homeowner. The officer chased the burglary suspect and ordered him to stop, but he did not comply. The officer, who was wearing body armor, eventually caught up to the burglary suspect, and the two struggled and wrestled on the ground. The homeowner caught up to the pair, produced his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and pointed it in the direction of the officer and the burglary suspect. The homeowner fired a single round at close range; the bullet struck the officer in the arms/hands. The burglary suspect got up and ran to an area behind the home. Additional officers arrived at the scene and took the burglary suspect into custody. Officers at the scene also arrested the 30-year-old homeowner, who knew the victim officer from a prior relationship through law enforcement (arrests, investigations, etc.).

The officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience, was still in his vehicle when the suspect shot at the officer with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. At some point, the man apparently exited his vehicle and continued firing as he walked toward the officer’s vehicle. The officer, who was wearing body armor, ducked down to the passenger side of the vehicle to avoid the first several shots, but was struck by a bullet in the back left shoulder and another in the back of his head. The offender then walked up to the car, placed the gun to the back of the officer’s head and fired a final and fatal shot. The man dropped the gun and fled the scene. Investigators established a suspect through the gun’s registration.

Department was shot and killed, and a 46-year-old police officer was wounded while responding to a robbery in progress about 10:25 a.m. on April 2. Two police officers responded in separate vehicles to a silent alarm at a local pawn store. They parked their vehicles in front of the store but out of sight of the store’s glass doors and windows. The officers went to the front glass doors and spotted the gunman at the counter. The gunman saw them and opened fire through the doors. Both officers retreated to their patrol cars for cover. As the 46-year-old officer, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, went to the trunk of his car to get his rifle, the suspect came to the glass doors, opened one of them, and began firing. The veteran officer was hit in the upper back; however, the bullet did not penetrate his body armor. Both officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who retreated into the shop. Moments later, most of the employees exited a side door. The suspect exited the same side door and jogged down an alley headed towards the rear of the building. At this time, the sergeant, a 27-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived in his marked patrol vehicle behind the suspect. The suspect turned and fired one round through the passenger side windshield of the sergeant’s vehicle. The sergeant struck the suspect with his vehicle; the suspect hit the hood and landed against the windshield, crushing it in. The sergeant stopped his vehicle and the suspect rolled off, knocking the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his hand. The suspect got up and ran, and the sergeant exited his vehicle and chased after him. As the suspect rounded a street corner, the sergeant deployed an electronic control device (ECD) and fired two darts at the suspect’s back. The ECD did not affect the suspect because he was wearing body armor. The suspect continued running, and according to a witness, he unzipped his jacket and pulled out a second weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The sergeant, who was also wearing a protective vest, drew his service weapon, and a gun battle ensued between the two men who were separated by less than 8 feet. As the sergeant attempted to reload his weapon, he was hit in the front of the head and died instantly. The suspect was hit in his chest, but his protective armor prevented any of the rounds from penetrating his body. He was also believed to have gunshot injuries to his groin area, but they did not incapacitate him. The suspect was walking away as the two officers who had first responded came upon the victim sergeant. The suspect shot at the officers, who returned fire, striking the back of his neck and his body armor. He dropped his weapon, tried to continue walking, but collapsed to the ground. The officers approached the suspect and handcuffed him. The 25-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with Felony Murder, First-Degree Murder, three counts of Attempted First-Degree Murder, and Aggravated Robbery. The officer injured in the first moments of the incident was transported to the hospital due to blunt trauma where the bullet impacted his body armor. He was later released and has since returned to duty.", "id.num": 1109}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824961Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T19:34:14.771820Z", "inner_id": 40,

{"text": "On June 20, a police officer with the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) was killed while transporting a prisoner. At 8:20 a.m., the 45-year-old veteran officer, who had more than 22 years of law enforcement experience, was transporting an individual to jail. The man had been arrested earlier that morning for aggravated assault following a domestic dispute with his wife. Seated in the rear of the patrol vehicle, the man managed to maneuver his hands, which were handcuffed, from behind his back to the front of his body. He then retrieved a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun that he had hidden on his person and pointed the gun at the officer through the sliding window that separated the front and rear seats. The individual fired a single round from the handgun at close range, striking the veteran officer in the right front upper torso/chest. The police vehicle then crashed into a light pole. Once it stopped, the suspect squeezed through the small sliding window and exited the vehicle through the front passenger door, leaving the weapon on the vehicle’s floor. The incident took approximately 12 seconds and was captured by the interior camera of the patrol vehicle. The victim officer was taken to a hospital where he died 30 minutes later. A massive manhunt for the suspect ensued. Local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies searched for the suspect throughout the day. At approximately 9 a.m. on June 21, a patrol unit spotted the suspect boarding a city bus. When the patrol officers stopped the bus, the suspect tried to flee, but the NOPD captured him. He was still wearing handcuffs, but the chain had been cut. The 33-year-old suspect, who was on parole at the time of the incident, was charged with First-Degree Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer, Aggravated Escape, and Weapons Law Violations. He was known to deal drugs and was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. He had a criminal history that included police assault, a violent crime, and a drug law violation.", "id.num": 885}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.824992Z", "updated_at":

The sergeant, a 10-year veteran of law enforcement, was called to a business’ parking lot where an armed robbery had occurred an hour prior, around 7 p.m. The suspect initially fled the scene, but the 911 caller reported that the suspect had returned. The sergeant and two SPD officers arrived at the area and observed the suspect sitting in a vehicle in the parking lot near where the robbery occurred. Body camera footage of the incident shows that when the suspect saw the officers approaching, he exited the vehicle and fired three rounds from a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the officers, fatally striking the sergeant in his waist/groin area, below his body armor. A 40-year-old police officer (with nearly 1 year of law enforcement experience) was also wounded in the front of his leg during the shooting. The suspect fled the scene on foot with the third SPD officer in pursuit. A bystander directed the pursuing officer where the suspect had fled, and the officer found the suspect exiting a shed in a nearby backyard, still brandishing the weapon. The officer fired three rounds from his patrol rifle, striking the suspect. The downed suspect was taken to a nearby medical center, where he died of his injuries. The victim sergeant was transported to the hospital as well, where he succumbed to his wounds later that night. The injured police officer, who was also wearing body armor during the incident, was treated for his gunshot wound and released. At the time of the incident, the suspect was on parole and had a criminal history that included aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, robbery, resisting arrest, and a weapons violation. He was known by the agency to be a drug dealer and a violent offender.", "id.num": 710}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825023Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T19:38:27.897058Z",

As suspected, the driver stopped at his  house, where he and three companions exited the vehicle and ran inside. The officers pursued the suspects into the residence, where they encountered several family members. One officer detained two combative females in the laundry area as the other officer, who had 7 years of law enforcement experience, began questioning relatives in another section of the home. Unknown to the officers, the offender had obtained a single-shot, 16-gauge shotgun from his bedroom.

parking lot of their precinct to begin their tours of duty. The officers walked together through the parking lot and passed a white box-type delivery truck parked near their building. Unknown to the officers, a 24-year-old offender had just shot and killed the driver of the delivery truck at a nearby store, stole the vehicle, and drove it to the police precinct with the intent to shoot and kill �police officers. Both officers were at the precinct's rear entrance when the offender approached them from behind and said, Hey guys, how are you doing? He immediately began firing at the officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The first officer was struck in the hand, causing him to fall to the ground. The offender then turned to the second officer and shot him in the face. The offender turned his attention back to the first officer and shot him in the head, killing him. As the offender retreated to the delivery truck, the second officer retrieved his service weapon and began firing at  the offender. A round struck the offender, but he made it to the delivery truck and attempted to drive away. The incident occurred during a shift change, so several officers quickly responded. A shootout ensued, and the offender was justifiably killed. The injured officer later recovered from his injuries and returned to full duty.", "id.num": 1226}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825085Z", "updated_at":

As he left the convenience store and walked to his police car, surveillance video showed a man exit a truck, walk up behind the victim deputy, and shoot him in the rear of the head. The victim deputy, who was wearing body armor, fell to the ground, and the subject continued to fire at him until he emptied the .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun of 15 rounds. The assailant then returned to his truck and left. The victim deputy, who not only suffered a fatal wound to the rear of his head, but also suffered wounds to his neck/throat and the rear upper torso/back, died at the scene of the shooting. Later that evening, a 30-year-old suspect, with a criminal history including a violent crime, a weapons violation, and police assault, was arrested at a residence near the convenience store. Also at that location, officers found the truck observed in the surveillance video and a .40-caliber handgun, subsequently identified as a match to the weapon used to kill the deputy.

Police Department died July 10 from injuries sustained in an incident nearly 20 years earlier. The officer, then 33 years old with more than 14 years of experience, was with one of several police units responding to a burglary in progress at a home at 3:30 p.m., March 18, 1985. He was securing an alley adjacent to the residence when a man opened a window of the home near where the officer was standing. The man attempted to get out of the house through the window apparently to evade other officers at the front and rear of the home. Upon seeing the officer in the alley, the man shot him twice at close range with a .357-magnum revolver he had taken from the residence. The suspect then jumped from the window and ran toward the backyard, where he apparently dropped the gun. He crossed neighboring properties by jumping several fences, including one around a swimming pool into which he fell. Officers in pursuit apprehended him in a courtyard of an apartment complex. The victim officer, who had bullet wounds in his neck and in the front of his head, was transported via police vehicle to a local medical facility. Several days later, surgeons removed a bullet from the back of his neck. Though shortly after the incident his condition showed improvement, the officer subsequently lapsed into a coma that lasted until his death. Police charged the perpetrator, who was 18 years old at the time of the incident, with Attempted First-Degree Murder, Use of a Firearm in the Commission of a Felony, and Aggravated Burglary. According to police reports, the suspect confirmed his involvement in the burglary and the shooting.", "id.num": 470}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825145Z", "updated_at":

officer with the Sebewaing Police Department was assaulted with his service weapon while handling and transporting a prisoner in Hampton Township. The veteran officer, who had more than 21 years of law enforcement experience, went to a residence to pick up a youth who was the subject of a juvenile detainer. The officer planned to transport him to a juvenile detention center in another county. At the residence, the officer handcuffed (double locked) the juvenile’s hands in the front and placed him in the backseat of the vehicle. When they arrived at the detention center, the officer exited the vehicle and opened the rear door. The juvenile, who was able to slip one of his hands out of the handcuffs, attacked the officer and attempted to grab the officer’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic revolver. The officer, who was wearing body armor, attempted to maintain control of his weapon; as they struggled, the handgun discharged. The officer was hit in the arms/hands. The juvenile gained control of the weapon, and the officer took cover behind parked vehicles at the detention center. The juvenile ran a short distance across the parking lot, then stopped and shot himself in the head. Both the officer and the juvenile were taken to a local hospital where the juvenile died a short time later. The veteran officer was treated for his gunshot wound and released. The 16-year-old offender was a known drug user and was on probation at the time of the incident. He had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime and a prior conviction.

and a 59- year-old deputy sheriff with the PCSO was wounded in Council Bluffs while transporting prisoners at 10:55 a.m. on May 1. The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail. The male prisoner exited the back of the van and immediately began assaulting the 43-year-old deputy, a 16-year law enforcement veteran, with a homemade cutting instrument, cutting the deputy’s head, neck, arms/hands, and front legs/feet. With the deputy down, the suspect ran to the driver’s seat of the van. The injured deputy, who was wearing body armor, recovered and entered the van through the front passenger’s side door. The 59-year-old deputy, who was also wearing body armor, ran to the driver’s side of the van to attempt to apprehend the suspect. During the struggle, the suspect gained possession of one of the deputy’s service weapons, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The suspect fatally shot the injured 43-year-old deputy in the side of the head with the service weapon. The suspect then shot the 59-year-old deputy in the front lower torso/abdomen below his protective vest and took possession of the other deputy’s service weapon. The injured 59-year-old deputy fell to the ground outside the van. The suspect exited the van and took the van keys and extra ammunition from the 59-year-old deputy. The suspect got back in the van, started it with the stolen keys, and fled the scene by ramming the closed sally port door. At 10:57 a.m., the suspect pulled up behind two motorists in a pickup truck at an intersection. The truck driver noticed the suspect exiting the van dressed in a yellow jumpsuit carrying a firearm and realized the man was an escaped prisoner. As the suspect attempted to open the driver’s side door of the truck, the truck driver tried to drive away, but the suspect fired one round through the truck’s window, striking the driver in the neck. The injured motorist continued driving until he drove into a ditch north of the intersection. The suspect returned to the van and fled. A few minutes later, the suspect drove up behind another vehicle stopped at a stop sign. The suspect drove past the vehicle and parked in front of it in the middle of an intersection. The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First- Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody. He had a criminal history that included murder charges. The deputies were transported to a local hospital where the 43-year-old deputy was pronounced dead. The 59-year-old deputy was treated for severe injuries. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured deputy had not returned to duty.", "id.num": 405}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825243Z", "updated_at":

Just before 3 p.m., two officers were dispatched to the call at a local park. The 29-year-old EPD officer, a veteran with more than 7 years of law enforcement experience, was on patrol and responded to the call as an additional unit. As the officer, who was wearing body armor, approached a creek in the park, the suspect opened fire with a .45-caliber semiautomatic weapon. The officer was struck in the front of the head. The suspect then began firing at the other two officers on scene. The officers encouraged the suspect to surrender, but instead, he positioned himself beside of the motionless victim officer and continued to fire. Additional officers arrived with sniper rifles and observed through their scopes that the victim officer appeared to be gravely injured. One of the officers fired two rounds at the suspect with the scoped rifle. The suspect stopped shooting and assisting officers were then able to safely respond to the injured officer and suspect. The senior police officer succumbed to his injury later that day. The 22-year-old suspect had been justifiably killed. The suspect was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident and had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, drug law violation, weapons violation, and an assaulting an

{"text": "Just before 5 a.m. on October 14, a 29-year-old deputy sheriff with the Marion County Sheriff’s Office was killed while investigating a suspicious circumstance. An apparently disabled vehicle was parked along a state highway near Waldo Township, and the veteran deputy, who had nearly 8 years of law enforcement experience, asked the dispatcher to contact a nearby gas station to learn if anyone had reported the abandoned vehicle. The gas station clerk informed the dispatcher, who, in turn, informed the officer, that two men had purchased gas a short time before and had left on foot. The deputy then spotted a man walking toward the vehicle and apparently had a conversation with him. The officer, who was wearing body armor, informed the dispatcher that he was going to give the man a ride to an apartment complex in Marion. The dispatcher ran a check on the information that the man had provided to the deputy and found that the man had given a false name and date of birth. The dispatcher tried to contact the officer numerous times via radio, cellular phone, and pager to warn him about the man, but none of the attempts to contact him were successful. At 5:03 a.m., the 911 center received a call from a citizen reporting that a marked sheriff’s cruiser had crashed and was lying on its top in a ravine. Investigating officers who responded to the call found the victim deputy in the wrecked cruiser with a single gunshot wound behind his right ear. The fatal shot had been fired from a 9 mm handgun. A 20- year-old male, a known user, dealer, and possessor of drugs, was arrested the next day and charged with Aggravated Murder. Investigators determined that the second man who had been present with the alleged assailant when he purchased gas at the service station had no involvement in the death of the victim officer.",

Police Department was wounded at 12:20 a.m. on June 5 during an arrest attempt and died from his injuries several days later. While the officer was on foot patrol, citizens told him that a vehicle was blocking an intersection and that the individual sitting on the vehicle’s trunk could be armed. As the officer approached, the individual got into his vehicle. The veteran officer, who had nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, ordered the man out of the vehicle, but the man put it into gear and rapidly accelerated, steering it directly at, and intentionally striking the officer. The officer, who was wearing body armor, tried to get clear of the vehicle, but the impact threw him onto the street, and the offender drove over both of the officer’s legs. The offender then sped off and hit a parked vehicle. Several witnesses forcibly detained the offender and restrained him until another officer arrived.

The 36-year-old trooper, who was a veteran with 14 years of law enforcement experience, requested assistance prior to the incident and was the first to respond to the residence. Upon arrival, the trooper heard gunfire, parked to the south of the scene, and approached on foot toward the suspect’s driveway. Almost immediately, the suspect discharged multiple rounds from his 5.56 mm semiautomatic rifle. The trooper, who was wearing body armor, was struck in the front upper torso/chest area by one round that penetrated his vest because the round was more powerful than the vest’s specifications. The injured trooper retreated toward his patrol vehicle where he succumbed to his injury. Subsequent investigation later revealed that the suspect was involved in a domestic dispute with his spouse before the incident. The suspect killed his spouse shortly before the trooper arrived. In addition, the suspect’s gunfire struck a woman residing in a shed on the property; she received non-life-threatening injuries. The 32-year-old suspect surrendered to responding state troopers and was charged with First-Degree Murder and Second-Degree Murder.", "id.num": 880}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Police Department (MPD) were stabbed and injured while answering a call for service on the afternoon of April 28. At 1:29 p.m., an MPD dispatcher received a 911 call from a frantic woman reporting someone was dying at a residence. The dispatcher sent all MPD units and an ambulance to the residence. Multiple officers responded around the same time and encountered a woman who was crying hysterically and saying “my daughter, my grandbaby” repeatedly. She led officers to a side door and gave them the keys to unlock it, as her hands were shaking too badly to do it herself. A group of four officers entered the kitchen, and one of them announced “police” loudly multiple times. In an attempt to clear the house, the officers split up. A 33-year-old police officer, who had 9 years of law enforcement experience, went downstairs with his weapon drawn to secure the basement, where he observed blood spots on the wet floor and a bathtub filled with bloody water in a bathroom. At the same time upstairs, officers walked down a hallway where they saw two closed doors and a number of handwritten notes stuck to the walls with unclear phrases written on them. They opened the first door and found a small, unresponsive child covered by a small blanket or towel and lying on a bed. Her cover included a note that appeared to ask God to accept “my baby.” The 53-year- old officer, who had 17 years of law enforcement experience, immediately started performing CPR on the child and radioed for EMS assistance; the other two officers continued clearing the house. The officers opened the second closed door and encountered a woman standing in the darkened bedroom holding both hands behind her back. She had a bleeding cut on her neck and was staring blankly at the officers. They repeatedly ordered the woman to show her hands, but she did not comply or speak. Additional officers arrived at the scene. Another officer switched places with the 53-year-old officer, and took over performing CPR on the child. The 53-year-old officer then entered the second bedroom with his weapon drawn and ordered the woman to show her hands and get on the floor. The officer had a light mounted on his firearm, which helped him clearly see the woman. As the 53-year-old officer started to switch his firearm for an electronic control device, the woman raised her hands above her head, clutching a large knife in each hand, and ran toward the officers. By this time, the 33-year-old officer had cleared the downstairs and joined the other officers. He and another officer deployed their electronic control devices, striking the suspect in her middle back and side. However, the shock had no effect on the woman. The suspect charged the officers, wildly swinging both knives. The officers backed away and used their arms to deflect the knives, then tripped and fell to the ground. The offender continued to slash at the officers, while they tried to kick the knives away from her. A third officer fired three rounds at the suspect, striking her twice and stopping her attack. The 53-year-old officer suffered a laceration to his left hand, and the 33-year-old officer was stabbed in the foot. Emergency services personnel arrived and began treating the injured offender while the 53-year-old officer returned to the child, who had no pulse, and began chest compressions again. Other officers began clearing the house. Another officer took over CPR on the child, while the 53-year-old officer returned to his patrol unit to retrieve his K-9 partner to help clear the building. On the second floor, the K-9 picked up the scent of a person behind a closed, locked door. An unarmed man exited the room with his hands up, and the officer handcuffed him. Officers later determined the man was a tenant and had nothing to do with the incident. Emergency personnel cleaned and bandaged both officers’ wounds and removed the deceased child to a waiting ambulance. Both officers went to a local hospital where they were treated and released. They have since returned to duty. The 28-year-old suspect, who was the mother of the deceased child, was arrested and charged with Second-Degree Murder, Second-Degree Assault, and Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer. She had no prior criminal record, but she was known to law enforcement for previous domestic violence calls.", "id.num": 1061}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825487Z", "updated_at":

The two deputies went to the home to investigate. One of the deputies knocked on the front door three times then entered the home. The man in the house opened fire on the officers with 22 shots from a 9 mm automatic rifle. The first deputy, who was 23 years old and had 1 year of law enforcement experience, was struck in the front below the waist and in the front of the head. The second deputy, who was 43 years old and had 3 years of law enforcement experience, was hit by a round in the chest. The first deputy died at the scene from the gunshot wound to his head. The second deputy was taken to a local hospital where he died later that day. The 26-year-old alleged assailant was arrested and charged with two counts of Murder.

Phoenix Police Department was shot while handling a person with a mental illness. The 34-year-old officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 7 years’ experience, was one of the officers who responded to a city park. Dispatchers had received a call from a person at the park who said he was sitting in a van and that men were pointing guns at him from bushes and houses in the area. Officers who arrived in the area made contact with the subject who appeared to be paranoid and delusional. The subject was in the driver’s seat and told the officers that he believed various people (including the police) were out to kill him, so he locked the doors and refused to exit. Officers used their equipment to conduct a search and electronically located an existing mental health order on the subject. They planned to remove the man from the vehicle and take him to a local mental health facility. One officer shot pepper spray through an opening in one of the vehicle’s windows while another officer, who was wearing body armor, broke out the passenger window. The subject pulled a semiautomatic handgun from behind his back and fired at the officer who had broken the window’s glass, striking the officer in his front upper torso/chest. The officer also suffered an eye injury (front head). Another officer fired at the subject, justifiably killing him. The subject was later discovered to have a history of a mental illness and a prior criminal record.

with the San Bernardino Police Department was assaulted and injured while responding to a traffic pursuit. The officer, with 2 years of law enforcement experience, responded to assist another officer who was attempting to pull over a vehicle that did not signal before a turn. The driver would not yield, and a 3-mile chase ensued. During the pursuit, a license plate check revealed the vehicle had been reported stolen. The suspect stopped the vehicle and fled on foot through the backyard of a residence, throwing a handgun aside as he ran. The officers chased the suspect until the assisting officer tackled him. The suspect refused to surrender or follow verbal commands and repeatedly struck the assisting officer with his fists. At one point, the suspect stabbed the victim officer, who was wearing body armor, in the arms/hands with a cutting instrument (scissors). The officers then administered empty-hand techniques to control the suspect, who was finally subdued and taken into custody. The 28-year-old suspect, who was on parole and had a prior criminal record , including a violent crime, weapons violation, and drug law violation, was charged with Assault with a Deadly Weapon on a Law Enforcement Officer, Grand Theft Auto, Felon in Possession of a Firearm, and Felony Evading.", "id.num": 172}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825605Z", "updated_at":

suspicious activity in a mall parking lot. Around 8:30 p.m. on November 6, 1980, the investigator and his partner traveled to a mall in the City of Orange to collect bail on a warrant. At that time, the investigator was 39 years old and an 8-year veteran of law enforcement. While driving their unmarked car through the lot, the investigators noticed three men tampering with a parked car. Two of the men were working under the hood, and a third man was inside the vehicle. The investigator and his partner were approaching the men on foot when the man inside the car opened the passenger door and pointed a handgun at the partner. The investigator removed his service weapon from his ankle holster and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. The man then turned and pointed his gun toward the investigator. The suspects at the front of the vehicle also drew weapons, and a gun battle erupted. The investigator was struck in the torso by two rounds fired from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Two of the offenders fled in the investigators’ unmarked vehicle, while the other offender fled on foot. While pursuing them in a high- speed car chase, California Highway Patrol units received gunfire from the two suspects. During the pursuit, the suspects lost control and crashed the unmarked unit, allowing officers to capture the two men and take them into custody. The man who escaped on foot was apprehended within days in Las Vegas, Nevada. The bullets that struck the investigator during the gun battle paralyzed him from the chest down. Over the next 29 years, he was confined to a wheelchair and required numerous medical procedures to address complications from his injuries. The three suspects were all on parole at the time of the shooting and were attempting to steal a vehicle to serve as a get-away car for a planned robbery. At the time of the incident, all three offenders were convicted of Attempted Murder and served prison sentences.", "id.num": 842}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825669Z",

officer with a traffic stop in Oxford. Although the responding officer had initiated the stop on the university’s grounds, the driver was pulled over at an off-campus convenience store for speeding. When the responding officer requested to see proof of insurance, the individual put the vehicle in reverse and backed toward the patrol vehicles. He then attempted to flee the scene. The backup officer, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, tried to stop the man from leaving by reaching into the driver’s window. The officer became entangled with the vehicle, and the man drove away, dragging the victim officer for several feet. Eventually, the victim officer became disentangled from the vehicle and fell to the pavement where he suffered a fatal head trauma. The victim officer also suffered injuries in the front of his body below the waist and on his arms/hands. He was transported to a local hospital and was then taken via helicopter to a hospital in Tennessee where he was pronounced dead later that day. The offender left the scene and drove to an apartment complex where he attempted to crash through an electronic entry gate. However, his vehicle became stuck in a ditch, and he abandoned it. He then walked to a friend’s apartment within the complex, called his parents, and told them that he had dragged a police officer with his vehicle. The offender’s parents called the Oxford Police Department. Shortly thereafter, responding officers arrived at the apartment and arrested the 20-year-old man without incident. The offender, who had a prior criminal record and who was allegedly under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time of the incident, was arrested and charged with Capital Murder.", "id.num":

corporal was killed and a 37-year-old patrol officer was injured when the pair, both from the Polk County Police Department, answered a call for service at 10:46 a.m. on September 29. The officer, who had less than 1 year of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a driveway in Cedartown. No passengers were in the parked vehicle, and a check of its registration showed the car had been reported stolen. The officer found a wallet in the vehicle with a woman’s identification card, Social Security card, and a credit or debit card. He did not yet have experience processing the paperwork associated with recovering a stolen vehicle, so he radioed for assistance. The detective, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 9 years of experience, radioed she was en route to help. The officer began work on his report as he sat in his marked patrol unit waiting on the detective and a tow truck to arrive. He soon heard footsteps in the leaves behind the vehicle. He leaned forward to get a better view of the area behind him when he saw a male and a female approaching the vehicle from the rear passenger side. The officer exited the patrol unit and asked the couple why they were in the area. The male pointed to the stolen vehicle and said they were there to retrieve the female’s wallet. The officer asked the female her name, and it matched the name on the items from the wallet. The detective arrived on the scene as the officer was instructing the pair to put their belongings on the ground. The male and female were leaning over very slowly and acting suspiciously as they placed their belongings on the ground when the male produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired two rounds at the officer from approximately 18 feet away. Both rounds struck the officer in his front upper torso/chest but were stopped by his body armor—one of the rounds hit his radio before striking the vest, rendering his radio useless. The officer fell to his knees and fired five rounds from his service weapon. None of the rounds struck the male, who had taken cover in front of the officer’s patrol unit. The male then moved to the passenger side of the car and fired four rounds at the detective. All four rounds struck the detective fatally in her front upper torso/chest, and she fell to the ground. The male then fired two additional rounds at the officer. After realizing his shoulder radio had been destroyed by a bullet, the wounded officer crawled to his patrol unit, quickly assessed the detective’s condition, and used the patrol unit’s radio to call for help. The two subjects appeared to have fled, so the wounded officer rapidly retrieved his shotgun from the trunk of the patrol unit and attempted to give the victim detective CPR until other personnel arrived, all while keeping watch for the subjects in case they returned. The victim detective succumbed to her injuries, and the injured officer was transported to a local hospital. The 31-year-old male offender was arrested later that day and charged with Malice Murder, Felony Murder, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, Theft by Receiving Stolen Property, Aggravated Assault Against a Police Officer During Official Duties, and Willful Obstruction of a Law Enforcement Officer by Use of Threats or Violence. He was on probation at the time of the incident; his criminal history included a drug law violation and a violent crime. The wounded patrol officer was treated and released from the hospital and has returned to duty.", "id.num": 259}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825737Z", "updated_at":

Department (HPD) was killed on May 18 while assisting in a traffic pursuit. Shortly before 3 a.m., officers responded to an attempted burglary of an automated teller machine (ATM). On their way to the scene, officers witnessed a commercial moving van speeding, making an illegal U-turn, and running a red light. As officers pursued the van, the driver fired a weapon multiple times toward them. The suspect eventually left the highway, drove to an adjacent road, stopped the van, and got out. He approached the driver of another vehicle, stole her vehicle at gunpoint, and continued to flee. One of the responding officers, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor, was positioned near the expected path of the suspect. While the officer was deploying a tire-deflation device across the roadway, he was struck by the fleeing vehicle causing fatal injuries. The suspect stopped the vehicle a few miles later, and officers on the scene heard a gunshot from within the vehicle. Responding officers set up a perimeter around the vehicle and waited for the HPD SWAT team to arrive. When the SWAT officers arrived, they approached the vehicle and found the 33-year-old suspect inside with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Officers recovered a shotgun and a handgun from the scene. Investigation later revealed that the hit-and-run suspect was probably not involved with the attempted burglary of the ATM but was driving erratically because the moving van was stolen. The suspect had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, a drug law violation, and a weapons violation. Shortly after 10 a.m. on June 24, a 38-year-old sergeant with the Hutto Police Department (HPD) was killed while attempting to make an arrest. Earlier that morning, another HPD officer observed a speeding vehicle and pursued the vehicle into a residential neighborhood but slowed the chase due to safety concerns. The officer caught up to the vehicle after it had wrecked into a fire hydrant. The driver exited the vehicle and fled on foot. The HPD sergeant, an 8-year veteran of law enforcement, was on patrol that morning wearing his uniform and body armor. The sergeant radioed that he would go to the area where the suspect was likely headed and look for him. When the sergeant radioed that he believed he had the suspect, additional HPD officers left the scene of the vehicle crash and went to assist the sergeant. As they arrived, the officers witnessed the suspect in the driver’s seat of the unmarked patrol unit and the sergeant standing at the driver’s door struggling with the suspect. The suspect put the patrol unit in reverse, with the wheels turned to the right, and then accelerated quickly, knocking the sergeant backward onto the ground and then backing over him. The suspect then put the patrol unit in drive and headed south. One of the responding officers exited his patrol vehicle to aid the sergeant, and the other officer pursued the stolen patrol vehicle. The suspect abandoned the unmarked patrol unit at an intersection and then fled on foot. The pursuing officer located the suspect and noticed that he had a hand restraint on his right wrist. The suspect jumped over a fence and began running through yards in an attempt to elude the officer. The officer continued his pursuit on the opposite side of the fence until an assisting HPD officer intercepted the subject. The assisting officer drew his duty weapon and yelled at the suspect to get on the ground. The man complied, and the officer finished placing the hand restraints on the suspect. The officer who stayed with the victim sergeant radioed that he had started CPR and requested emergency personnel; however, the victim sergeant died from severe head trauma. The 26- year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a drug law violation, was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon on a Public Servant.", "id.num": 440}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825807Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-14T23:21:10.182064Z", "inner_id": 67, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19148, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97057328, "annotations": [{"id": 32657333, "completed_by": {"id": 19148, "email": "anaislauper@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "ES8WwE-Wkv", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 26, "text": "12:30 a.m", "start": 17, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "rHC5N8o-ao", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 13, "text": "November 1", "start": 3, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "DAjlLpfCAH", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 61, "text": "45-year-old off-duty constable", "start": 31, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "lQek_n5Pye", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 104, "text": "El Paso County Constable’s Office", "start": 71, "labels": ["Department"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "6O9B24WJOr", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed", "Feloniously Killed"], ["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Assignment", "Police call"], ["Situation", "Encounter"], ["Situation", "Pursuit"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "39EDqnmQ7k", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 384, "text": "18 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 346, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-14T23:22:49.305554Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-14T23:22:49.305575Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-14T23:21:24.378180Z", "lead_time": 98.496, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "2d50ce4e-9641-4dad-ab4b-aa9d073459ac", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057328, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19148, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19148}, {"id": 32590306, "completed_by": {"id": 19169, "email": "lucyingram@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "t8fipwnSAc", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 13, "text": " November 1", "start": 2, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "rbPmiDxjql", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 26, "text": "12:30 a.m", "start": 17, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "DLyzz4ifPr", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 43, "text": "45-year-old ", "start": 31, "labels": ["Age"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "tS6z-UFOaf", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 60, "text": "off-duty constabl", "start": 43, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "G7CYIy6nWJ", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 104, "text": "El Paso County Constable’s Office", "start": 71, "labels": ["Department"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "jw6QMcmNX3", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 383, "text": " 18 years of law enforcement experienc", "start": 345, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "EFnJkGzakA", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed", "Feloniously Killed"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-14T05:13:40.378999Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-14T05:13:40.379016Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-14T05:12:52.150812Z", "lead_time": 58.004, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "814d2d08-f17b-4083-a89e-8cc23ab7e8ff", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057328, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19169, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19169}], "file_upload": "f3d2399a-data8.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 53.53729603729603, "data": {"text": "On November 1 at 12:30 a.m., a 45-year-old off-duty constable with the El Paso County Constable’s Office was killed while handling a disturbance call in El Paso.

officer with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department died in a mass shooting. The 34-year-old officer was attending a music festival with his wife and friends. Shortly after 10 p.m., the police department received a call reporting gunfire at the festival. Uniformed officers working the event confirmed that several people had been shot and requested assistance. In an interview on October 18, the officer’s wife reported their group, seated on the east side of the venue, began hearing pops. She thought they were fireworks, but the officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with almost 12 years’ experience, knew it was gunshots. He immediately positioned himself in front of her and their friends to shield them. The officer instructed the group to lie down and calmed them and other festival attendees in his vicinity. As the officer attempted to remove his companions from the venue, a round from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle struck him, and he fell to the ground. There were several volleys of gunfire, and another round struck the officer as he was on the ground. Meanwhile, the police discovered an offender on an upper floor of a hotel overlooking the venue who was shooting at the festival attendees below. Hotel security informed police of the offender’s exact location after he shot a hotel security guard. Police officers made their way to the hotel room and breached the door. There they found the 64-year-old offender lying on the floor dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound from a handgun. They also recovered 23 rifles from the hotel room. Investigation revealed the offender had fired more than 1,000 rounds in all. Officials located, documented, and recovered 31 victims from the venue and its exterior perimeter, and emergency personnel transported the remaining victims to various local hospitals. The officer’s body was located at one such hospital with a fatal gunshot wound to the front upper torso/chest and another shot to the rear upper torso/back. Fifty-eight individuals died in the mass shooting. The offender had no prior criminal history.", "id.num": 969}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825897Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-14T23:29:25.327437Z", "inner_id": 70, "total_annotations":

The veteran sergeant, with nearly 16 years of law enforcement experience, and a uniformed primary officer were in the street in front of the residence when a radio broadcast was made indicating that the suspect in the original domestic disturbance report was in custody at a nearby location. It was later determined that this person was actually a witness to the incident and not a suspect. The sergeant and primary officer approached the open front door of the residence while other responding officers detained people outside. Inside, a man had created a concealed firing position by overturning a couch at the top of the stairway adjacent to the front door. As the officers entered, the man, armed with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle, fired multiple rounds, striking the sergeant in the chest and back. The victim sergeant managed to exit the house and fell on the porch 10 feet outside of the home. The primary officer returned fire, and the suspect moved to a second floor window where he had previously constructed a firing platform. He fired at the officers and patrol cars below. When officers returned fire at the suspect, he moved to another window and fired again. The detective, who had nearly 9 years of law enforcement experience, began firing at the suspect with an AR-15 rifle. The detective, who was wearing a tactical vest, was struck in his left leg by a round fired by the suspect. Despite his injuries, he remained engaged in the gun battle. The 21-year-old suspect emerged from the front door and began firing rounds at the victim sergeant who was still lying on the porch and inflicted a fatal wound to the rear of the sergeant’s head. After retreating inside the dwelling for a brief period of time, the shooter, a known drug user with a criminal history and who was under the influence of narcotics, reemerged firing his rifle at the officers. During the ensuing 8-minute gun battle in which the offender fired 49 shots, he was killed by return gunfire from the six armed officers.", "id.num": 357}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

{"text": "On November 18, two veteran patrol officers with the Ridgewood Police Department (Ridgewood PD) sustained injuries while handling a person with a mental illness. Shortly after 2 p.m., the two officers, a 42-year-old with nearly 15 years of law enforcement experience and a 33-year-old with nearly 9 years of experience, responded to a disturbance call from a residential mental health center. When officers arrived on scene along with a Ridgewood PD sergeant, a case worker explained a resident was agitated and had insinuated that he might burn down the center. The case worker explained to the officers he had called an operator at the local psychiatric emergency screening program and requested a screener to evaluate the resident. However, the operator advised the case worker that screeners were not available at that time and suggested he call the police instead. The officers located the resident in his bedroom on the second floor and explained the reason they were called. When the resident became agitated once again, the officers suggested that they escort him to the hospital for an evaluation. While the two officers continued to speak to the resident, the sergeant again contacted the emergency screening program. An operator confirmed that no one was available to come to the center to provide a screening. The operator also told the sergeant that following a previous violent crime, a superior court placed the resident on Krol Status (i.e., the superior court was monitoring his mental health treatment). The operator then recommended to the sergeant that the resident be transported to the hospital for an evaluation. Meanwhile, the resident was making threats and arguing with the two officers. The sergeant informed the operator that the resident’s condition was worsening and that he would transport him to the hospital as recommended. The sergeant then requested backup and an ambulance. The sergeant explained to the resident he was to be taken to a local hospital for evaluation. Initially, the resident refused and stated that he would fight the officers. The two officers continued to talk to the resident and eventually convinced him to comply. At that time, another officer and a member of Ridgewood Emergency Services arrived; they all escorted the resident to the first floor. Before exiting the center, the sergeant told the resident that he needed to search him for hidden weapons. Once again, the resident became very agitated and refused to be transported. The sergeant advised the resident that a weapon search was standard procedure and requested his cooperation. The resident refused to comply, clenching his fist and taking a combative stance. The 42-year-old officer moved in and attempted to grab the resident, who reached into his left pocket and pulled out a folding metal knife with the blade open. When the resident raised the knife into the air, the 33-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, joined the scuffle. Both officers grabbed the resident’s arm as they wrestled to control him. The resident swung the knife at the 33-year-old officer’s head, slicing the officer’s hat. During the struggle, the 33-year-old officer received a puncture wound on his arms/hands, and the 42-year-old officer received a laceration on his arms/hands. The officers pulled the 55-year-old resident to the ground, disarmed him, and placed him in handcuffs. The resident remained combative as he was immobilized and placed on a stretcher. He was taken into custody and transported to a local hospital for an evaluation. The resident had a prior criminal record including police assault, a violent crime, weapons violations, and drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. The resident was charged with Aggravated Assault. Both officers were taken to a local hospital where they were treated and released. They have recovered from their injuries and have returned to their duties.", "id.num": 1194}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.825996Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-14T23:55:46.440022Z",

"A corporal with the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), Pittsburgh, was shot and killed following a high- speed traffic pursuit well before dawn on December 12. The 45-year-old corporal began midnight-shift duty for the PSP-Pittsburgh station at 11 p.m. on December 11. About 1:55 the next morning, he contacted the PSP dispatch center to report his pursuit of a vehicle for a traffic violation and to request assistance. After the vehicle crashed onto the curb at a motel entrance, the corporal ordered the two passengers, who had gotten out of the car on the passenger side, to show their hands. He also commanded the driver to move to the trunk area on the driver’s side of the car. The driver reportedly became verbally combative and refused to comply with the command. According to one of the passengers, when the corporal tried to place the driver’s hands on the car, the driver attempted to attack the corporal physically. The corporal then sprayed the suspect with pepper spray, but the suspect grabbed the officer’s arm and hand. During this struggle, the suspect allegedly took the corporal’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him multiple times. The victim corporal, who had nearly 24 years of law enforcement experience, suffered wounds to the neck and throat. The fatal bullet entered his chest through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor. The passengers fled the scene on foot before the shooting began but later reported hearing gunshots fired in rapid succession. The suspect left the scene in his own vehicle. Assisting officers discovered the victim corporal at 2:05 a.m. on the ground of the motel parking lot entrance. The emergency lights of his marked PSP vehicle were still flashing, and the driver’s door was open. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 2:26 a.m. Later that day, with the help of a confidential informant, officers were able to locate the suspect driver and the two passengers. One of the passengers reported receiving a cell phone call from the suspect, who allegedly referred to the shooting during the call. The suspect reportedly placed a second call requesting that the passenger return to the scene and retrieve a Glock handgun. The passenger refused to do so. The passenger reported that he had observed the suspect attempting to conceal the Glock under the driver’s seat prior to encountering the corporal. Members of a PSP forensic services unit subsequently found the fully loaded Glock in shrubbery near the motel parking lot. The 30-year-old suspect, who was under supervised parole at the time of the incident, had an extensive criminal history record, including prior convictions for weapons violations and drug-related crime. He was not licensed to carry a firearm. He was arrested on December 14 and charged with Criminal Homicide, Disarming a Law Enforcement Officer, Resisting an Arrest, Violation of Use of Firearm, Theft, and Fleeing the Police.", "id.num":

planned drug raid.

The agents exited their vehicle and went to the house where they found a man in possession of controlled substances. The agent identified himself as a law enforcement officer and gained control of the man. Suddenly, another man appeared with an unknown caliber handgun and shot the agent in the front of his head and in his rear upper torso/back. Both suspects escaped to a wooded area outside the residence. Paramedics arrived to assist, but the victim agent died from the head wound while at the scene.

When the woman finally unlocked the door, the officer entered the residence. As the officer was halfway through, he heard the captain yelling, so he ran out the front door and went to the back of the apartment. The victim captain was at his patrol unit holding his left arm and appeared to have a dislocated shoulder. He stated that a struggle had ensued with the suspect during which the suspect hit him several times and knocked him down before fleeing towards the end of the apartment complex. The officer called for medical assistance and backup. The victim captain was transported to a hospital for injuries to his front upper torso/chest and the rear of his head.

Angeles County Sheriff’s Office died of injuries he received in an unprovoked attack on December 10, 1994, in Rowland Heights. The then 29-year-old veteran deputy, who had 7 years of law enforcement experience, made a felony traffic stop shortly before 6 p.m. and was in the process of handcuffing and placing the subject in his patrol vehicle, when a man on a skateboard approached from behind. As he neared the deputy, the skateboarder pulled out a .357-caliber revolver and held it to the back of the deputy’s head and ordered the deputy to release the arrestee. The skateboarder then shot the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the back of the head. The arrestee exited the patrol vehicle and fled the scene in his own vehicle with the skateboarder. The 20-year-old alleged shooter, who had prior arrests for a drug law violation and was a known user of controlled substances, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a nearby town. The arrestee turned himself in to the Corona Police Department. He later pleaded guilty to the felony charge of Assault on a Peace Officer and received a 14-year prison term. The deputy sustained significant brain injuries, which led to his death in 2018 at the age of 53.

The man pulled a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from under the right side of his shirt and shot the sergeant and the deputy at close range. Both officers were wearing body armor at the time of the incident. The sergeant was fatally wounded in the front of the head and the deputy was wounded in the front lower torso/stomach, in the front below the waist, and fatally in the front of his head. The original complainant heard gunshots from the neighboring residence and again called 911. Three Byron Police Department (BPD) units responded and the suspect fired a rifle at them. The BPD officers returned fire and the suspect was struck and apprehended. The victim sergeant succumbed to his injuries that day, and the victim deputy died on November 8.

The 23-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, weapons violation, and drug law violation, was arrested and charged with First-Degree Felony Murder.", "id.num": 630}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826211Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-15T00:21:25.041794Z", "inner_id": 80, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19148, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97057341, "annotations": [{"id": 32658616, "completed_by": {"id": 19148, "email": "anaislauper@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "Qn3GCijQ0G", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 28, "text": "Chattanooga police officer", "start": 2, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "qRWG3HUNqL", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 78, "text": "4 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 41, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "khNlmzyMx2", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 159, "text": " .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun", "start": 125, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Qkd-Krg2Yp", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed", "Feloniously Killed"], ["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Situation", "Pursuit"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "9zSn7qQw1I", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 496, "text": "1:30 p.m", "start": 488, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "A0tSP9YaNu", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 506, "text": "May 6", "start": 501, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "xovbWgIPAH", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 560, "text": "police officer", "start": 546, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "i23mULxX0S", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1741, "text": " influence of narcotics", "start": 1718, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-15T00:30:49.425303Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-15T00:30:49.425320Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-15T00:24:12.125859Z", "lead_time": 563.736, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "15edbaf1-682f-4434-b9d9-2f895f071166", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057341, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19148, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19148}, {"id": 32652887, "completed_by": {"id": 19169, "email": "lucyingram@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "GQd7_YlFP3", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 13, "text": "Chattanooga", "start": 2, "labels": ["Department"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "2PnxP1iU-h", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 27, "text": "police office", "start": 14, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "eXHjzKhBSU", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 78, "text": "nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 34, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "ZCSjQqI_Bl", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Killed", "Feloniously Killed"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "rffmfiLKxz", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 160, "text": ".45-caliber semiautomatic handgun,", "start": 126, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "_2MGJkIbo9", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 496, "text": " shortly before 1:30 p.m", "start": 472, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Uouc-C8xG8", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 508, "text": "May 6.

The 26-year-old officer was wearing body armor when she was shot seven times at close range in the front of the head, the front upper torso, arms, and fatally in the rear of the head. The incident occurred shortly before 1:30 p.m. on May 6. Earlier that day, another Chattanooga police officer had transported the male student to the hospital for a mental evaluation after school officials reported that the student was a danger to himself or others. While awaiting evaluation, the student escaped from the examination room, and the officer who had trans- ported him to the hospital began chasing him. The officer requested assistance. Responding to the request, the victim officer notified the police dispatcher that she had the suspect in sight and that he was running. A few seconds later, the victim officer radioed the dispatcher that she was struggling with the suspect, and about 20 seconds after that, the officer said the suspect was trying to get her gun. Additional responding officers arrived at the scene to find the suspect was standing over the victim officer, who was lying on the ground. The 20-year- old male attempted to elude the responding officers but was taken into custody less than a block from the scene. After the shooting, the suspect had apparently thrown the victim officer’s weapon into a drainage culvert, but other officers later recovered it during the crime scene investigation. The man, who was apparently under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder.", "id.num": 491}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

The officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience at the time, was sitting in his marked patrol vehicle when he noticed two men in a van pull into a hotel across the street. He ran the van’s license plate number and learned that the van was registered to a man who had three outstanding arrest warrants. The officer drove into the hotel’s parking lot and saw the van was now backed up to the door of a hotel room, and the two individuals were unloading items from the van into the room. The officer parked his vehicle, got out, and approached the driver. He asked the man if he was the owner of the van; the man said he was. The officer told the man that he was under arrest, and he attempted to take him into custody. However, the man resisted and pulled away from the officer, who sent out a call for backup via his portable police radio. As the two struggled, the officer’s right arm became tangled with the subject’s left arm. Then, the officer, who was wearing body armor, heard two gunshots and felt a burning sensation in his left arm and the left side of his chest. Realizing he had been shot, the officer disengaged from the subject, took cover in an adjacent lot, and notified responding officers that he had been shot. The suspect, armed with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, approached the open door of the van and fired additional rounds at the officer but missed. The suspect then got into the van and drove through the parking lot. At the same time, officers from the Swartz Creek Police Department (SCPD) arrived at the scene. The first SCPD officer pulled his vehicle into the parking lot and drove through a snow bank to position himself behind the van. The second SCPD officer stopped his vehicle behind the first SCPD officer’s car. The suspect stopped the van, put it in reverse, and rammed the first SCPD officer’s vehicle. Then, the suspect exited the van and fired at the first SCPD officer who was still seated in his car. The first SCPD officer returned fire, striking the man several times. The second SCPD officer exited his vehicle and sought cover behind it as the suspect started shooting at him. After being shot, the offender eventually fell to the ground, and officers arrested him. The 55-year-old man was taken to a local hospital for treatment. He was charged with two counts of Assault with Intent to Murder, Carrying a Concealed Weapon, Possession of a Weapon by a Felon, Assaulting/Resisting/Obstructing a Law Enforcement Officer—Causing Serious Bodily Injury, and Attempting to Kill a K-9. The victim patrol officer was also taken to a local hospital for treatment to his wounds, including the one to his chest that had been covered by the officer’s protective vest. The wounded officer has since returned to duty.", "id.num": 263}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826275Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-15T00:38:15.981062Z", "inner_id": 82,

sergeant with the New York Police Department was shot and fatally wounded, and a 30-year-old sergeant was shot and injured during a traffic pursuit and stop. Earlier in the day, around 11:20 a.m., a man forced his way into his estranged wife’s apartment, displayed a firearm, and attempted to forcibly remove their 3-year-old son from the residence. A resident of the home attempted to calm the man for approximately 3 hours before convincing him to leave the premises without the child. Once the man was gone, the woman called 911 and reported the incident. The 41-year-old sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 19 years of experience, and another officer began searching for the suspect’s vehicle using details provided by dispatchers. The sergeant and the officer, in a marked police vehicle, spotted the suspect’s vehicle and followed it. The sergeant provided their location to dispatch, allowing other police units to converge on the area. The suspect attempted to evade the pursuing officers by turning onto a succession of streets, but responding officers eventually blocked the suspect’s path with their police vehicles. To avoid the blockade, the suspect attempted a U-turn. However, another police vehicle collided with the rear of the suspect’s vehicle, causing him to lose control and strike a parked dump truck. With the suspect’s vehicle trapped between the dump truck and a police vehicle, responding officers attempted to take him into custody. The sergeant and the officer exited their police vehicle and, along with other officers, approached the suspect’s vehicle. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, approached the driver’s side of the suspect’s vehicle with his service weapon drawn. Without warning, the suspect shot the sergeant in the left side of the head at close range with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The suspect fired two more rounds and struck the 30-year-old sergeant, who was also wearing body armor, once in the front below his waist. The 30-year-old sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 9 years of experience, sustained a graze wound to his left leg. Other officers returned fire, justifiably killing the suspect. With the suspect down, officers requested emergency medical services for the injured officers. Both sergeants were transported to a local hospital where the 41-year-old sergeant succumbed to his wound. The other sergeant was treated for the injury to his leg and released. The 35-year-old suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. He had a prior criminal record which included a drug law violation and an assaulting an officer/resisting arrest charge. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured sergeant had not returned to duty.", "id.num": 183}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826308Z", "updated_at":

{"text": "A deputy with the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Department was shot on October 19 at 4:15 p.m. while responding to a domestic disturbance call in Green Lake. When the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Department received a 911 call from a woman whose husband allegedly had hit her and taken their infant hostage in their apartment, the Department dispatched a patrol car to the scene. While the woman remained on the telephone with the dispatcher, the man went into the bedroom where he had several firearms. The woman then was able to take the infant and her daughter from the living room. She exited the apartment building and went to her car. At that time, the patrol car with two deputies arrived at the scene; shortly thereafter, another deputy, who was 38 years old and had over 14 years’ law enforcement experience, arrived. The deputies conferred briefly and decided that the deputies who were first to arrive would establish a roadblock farther down the street. The remaining deputy, who was wearing body armor, opened his trunk and began to remove his tactical rifle. Undetected, the suspect went out onto the apartment’s second-floor balcony and shot the deputy with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle in the chest and fatally above his protective vest in the neck and the throat. Witnessing the shooting, the woman and her children fled to safety at a nearby apartment building where she called 911 and reported an officer down. The suspect then yelled threats toward the street and fired two additional shots at a man who had stopped and exited his vehicle to assist the victim officer; the man abandoned his vehicle and fled the scene on foot. The deputies at the roadblock radioed the victim deputy and received no response. Shortly thereafter, the dispatcher requested additional assistance because an officer was down. The suspect reentered the apartment, fired at least ten additional rounds into the interior entry door and wall of the apartment, and entered the bedroom, firing more shots. After receiving notification that there was an officer down, one of the deputies who had established the roadblock worked his way to the scene and approached the area where the victim deputy lay, ordering citizens into their houses. The deputy dragged the victim deputy to safety on the driver’s side of the squad car and attempted to resuscitate him. At that time, the suspect shot at the assisting deputy from the bedroom window. The deputy returned fire across the hood of the car toward an apartment window in which the glass had been broken and the blinds were moving. When the shooting stopped, the deputy attempted to drag the victim deputy from the scene; two additional officers responding to the incident assisted in putting the victim deputy in the squad car. The victim deputy was transported to a local fire department, then to a medical center where he was pronounced dead at 6:30 p.m. Shortly after firing shots from the bedroom, the 21-year-old suspect, who had no known prior arrests, used a 9 mm pistol to shoot himself in the head. Because officials thought the suspect had barricaded himself in the apartment, they evacuated local residents. After several hours, SWAT teams from the Winnebago County Sheriff’s Department and the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Department entered the apartment and found the suspect dead.", "id.num": 517},

At 6:48 a.m., a woman called Yell County 911’s nonemergency line to report that her daughter’s boyfriend had come to their residence and threatened to kill them. The individual, who was known to law enforcement for several previous domestic violence calls, had punched the woman’s daughter and granddaughter. The woman scared the man away by firing shots into the ground and reported to dispatch that she did not think he was armed. Around the same time, a neighbor also called 911 to report the disturbance and provided a description of the truck the man was driving. The lieutenant located the suspect’s truck and conducted a traffic stop. At 7:18 a.m., a passing motorist called dispatchers to report an officer down at the location of the traffic stop. Another officer responded to the scene where he found the lieutenant critically wounded by rounds from his own service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. One round had struck the front of the lieutenant’s head and his neck/throat. A second round had penetrated his body armor and struck his front upper torso/chest. The lieutenant was transported to a hospital where he succumbed to his chest wound. At 7:43 a.m., the same neighbor called to report she thought more people had been injured at her neighbor’s residence and that the suspect had wrecked his truck nearby and had run toward the residence. A number of officers converged on the residence where they found two female victims had been shot and killed. The original caller had died in front of her residence, and a young female had died on the front porch. The officers heard voices from inside the residence and ordered the suspect to come out. A female responded that she was wounded and being held hostage. The suspect demanded a pizza, a million dollars, and a helicopter. The suspect called 911, and an officer began negotiating with him via telephone.

While investigating the surrounding area, the corporal and patrol officer, who were both wearing body armor, approached an outbuilding. As they examined the building, a subject appeared and began firing a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun in the direction of the patrol officer, who was hit in the front of his head. The corporal fired his weapon at the subject and attempted to take him into custody, but the subject shot the corporal in the neck/throat. Additional officers arrived at the scene and took the subject into custody. The corporal and patrol officer were both transported to a local hospital, where both died that morning. The 25-year-old subject, who had a prior criminal record and was on parole at the time of the incident, was also taken to a local hospital for gunshot wounds.

55-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 36 years of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to an apartment to escort a woman’s boyfriend to remove his belongings from her residence. Earlier that day, the woman had obtained a restraining order against her boyfriend. The officer, the woman and her young child, her aunt, and the boyfriend went down a hallway and climbed stairs to the top floor where the woman lived. As the woman opened her door, the boyfriend forced the woman inside and quickly closed the door, leaving the officer and the aunt in the hallway. The officer tried to force the door open, and he and the aunt heard the woman pleading with her boyfriend and then heard a gunshot. The aunt ran from the top floor, and as she fled, she heard more gunshots and a scuffle. The aunt hid in an alcove at the bottom of the stairwell and asked a tenant in a nearby apartment to call the police. The aunt then heard someone come down the stairs and leave the building. A witness saw a man walk from the building to a vehicle while holding or concealing something to the front of his pants. Calls were made to 911, and responding law enforcement officers found the victim officer on the top floor landing with several gunshot wounds. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, had been shot with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at close range in his arms/hands, front upper torso/chest, and fatally in the front of his head. Officers found the woman inside the apartment with a gunshot wound to the face. Both victims were taken to a local hospital where the officer was pronounced dead at 1:31 p.m. The woman underwent surgery and was in stable condition after the incident. The aunt provided information to law enforcement officers about the suspect, who was in his mid-30s, and about the suspect’s vehicle. Officers found his vehicle parked in front of the apartment building, and the suspect was slumped over the steering wheel with a self- inflicted gunshot wound to the front upper torso/chest and a 9 mm handgun on the floor between his feet. Officers checked for a pulse and began first aid. The suspect was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:46 p.m.", "id.num": 893}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826441Z", "updated_at":

"agreement": 37.90138224348751, "data": {"text": "A corporal with the Detroit Police Department (DPD) was killed and a DPD police officer was injured while responding to a home invasion in progress around 7 p.m. on November 20. Upon arriving at the scene, the 46-year-old corporal and the 32-year-old police officer parked one house north of the residence being invaded and met with two women from the residence outside on the street. When the women told the officer that the intruder had a large firearm, they notified dispatch to advise other officers in the area. Because there were no lights on inside the residence except for in the basement, the officers checked the windows with their flashlights and saw no movement. However, when the corporal walked down the driveway to check the side of the house, he heard footsteps, so he retreated and called for backup. Once a couple of backup units arrived, officers unlocked the front door with keys provided by the homeowners and announced themselves, receiving no response. The officers entered the door, split up into smaller groups, and began clearing the residence. Other officers stayed outside to cover the basement door and the front entrance. The first officers to respond—the corporal who had 16 years of law enforcement experience and the police officer who had 3 years of law enforcement experience—led three other officers downstairs toward the basement. The corporal announced their presence and shouted multiple verbal commands. Before the officers reached the bottom of the stairs, a gunshot rang out and the veteran corporal fell to the ground. Officers could not determine where the shot came from. After a brief pause, the offender fired more rounds. The other four officers sought cover by running up the stairs and out of the residence. As the last officer made it to the top of the steps, he was struck with a round in his rear legs. The 32-year-old victim officer ran outside and collapsed in front of one of the patrol units. Another officer dragged him behind the vehicle as the offender, who had apparently run up the steps and out a side door, fired several more rounds, then fled into a nearby alley. Meanwhile, two officers taking cover with the victim officer attempted first aid, loaded the injured officer into a patrol unit and transported him to a hospital where he was treated and expected to recover. At the residence, officers called for backup, and within minutes more than 40 DPD officers swarmed the area, some to assist at the residence and others to canvass the neighborhood for the offender and to direct traffic from the congested area. Officers found a rifle that the offender had dropped and a trail of blood. One of the women advised an officer that she was the offender’s girlfriend, told him of a recent domestic situation with the offender, and showed the officer a picture of him on her cell phone. As some officers began clearing the residence again, one officer entered the side door with his weapon drawn. He immediately saw the victim corporal lying at the bottom of the basement stairs and radioed for emergency medical services. Officers carried the victim corporal outside to one of the patrol units and transported him to the hospital. Shortly after their arrival, the victim corporal died from the fatal gunshot wound received in his neck/throat, above his body armor. As officers continued to canvass the neighborhood, they saw a handprint on a garage door a few streets away and radioed for backup. Other officers noticed someone lying under bushes in front of a residence near the garage. When they ordered the individual to show his hands, there was no response. One of the officers grabbed the individual’s legs and pulled him out. The officer immediately recognized the individual as the offender from the photo previously provided and observed a large gunshot wound on his right forearm with the bone exposed. One officer called for medical personnel and another officer tried to stop the bleeding. Officers secured the offender with handcuffs before medics transported him to the hospital. The 28-year-old offender, who has a criminal history that includes a weapons violation, had been recently released from parole. He was arrested and charged with Murder/Non-Negligent Manslaughter (Voluntary) and Aggravated/Felonious Assault.", "id.num": 499}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826477Z",

police headquarters around 11:45 a.m. on November 20. Moments prior to the incident, the detective, a veteran of law enforcement who had nearly 21 years of experience, had stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation on the street in front of the police department. As the detective sat in his patrol unit handling matters associated with the traffic stop, a vehicle pulled up behind him. A man exited the vehicle, ran up to the passenger-side door of the patrol unit, and fatally shot the detective in the back of his head with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The subject then reached in and fired a second shot into the side of the victim detective’s head before retreating to his vehicle and fleeing the area. The SAPD used surveillance video from its building to request assistance from the community in identifying the vehicle and its owner. The next day, the SAPD received a tip on the suspect’s identity. Working with the U.S. Marshal’s Service, authorities tracked the suspect’s telephone and found his last call was to his girlfriend. In response to information about the suspect’s identity, his girlfriend’s identity, and a description of the girlfriend’s vehicle, authorities spotted the vehicle that afternoon at a nearby gas station. Soon after, SAPD SWAT officers conducted a tactical vehicle stop as the suspect and his girlfriend were leaving the gas station. Officers apprehended the suspect, who had a prior criminal record which included a violent crime, weapons violation, and drug law violation. The 31-year-old offender was arrested and charged with Capital Murder. During a custodial interview, the man confessed to shooting and killing the detective.", "id.num": 458}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826507Z", "updated_at":

was shot and killed while investigating suspicious persons. The veteran sergeant, who had nearly 18 years of police experience, was working a plainclothes detail with his partner at an area bar. The two sergeants were captured on a video surveillance camera in the street at the rear of the bar shortly after 2 a.m. engaged in a verbal altercation with two male subjects. Following the exchange, the two officers walked from the parking lot and left in separate vehicles for headquarters to end their shift. According to a witness, one of the sergeants pulled in front of the bar and one of the male subjects stepped in front of the officer’s car and resumed the verbal confrontation. As the sergeant observed the second male subject also returning to the confrontation, he called the other sergeant to return and assist him. Both subjects subsequently turned and walked down an alley just as the other sergeant arrived on the scene. The returning sergeant followed them down the alley. As he got close to one of the men, the subject turned and fired a .38-caliber revolver at the victim sergeant, striking him twice in the front upper chest and once in the back upper torso. The second sergeant entered the alley and reached the victim sergeant, who indicated that he was badly hurt. The second sergeant saw one of the subjects silhouetted against a garage and fired at the man but did not hit him. The victim sergeant died as a result of his wounds. Officers established a perimeter at the location of the shooting and arrested both suspects within 4 hours. The two men, a 32-year-old, with a lengthy record that included a prior arrest for murder, and a 27-year-old, also with a prior record, were charged with First-Degree and Second- Degree Murder.",

Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (Sacramento County SD) was killed while investigating suspicious persons. A few hours later that same day, a 42-year-old detective with the Placer County Sheriff’s Office (Placer County SO) was killed, and a Placer County SO deputy sheriff was injured as a result of a traffic pursuit involving the same offender. About 10:30 a.m., the Sacramento County SD deputy and his partner were investigating a suspicious vehicle parked behind a hotel in Sacramento. As they walked up to the car, a woman exited, went behind the car, and shut the trunk. The deputy, a 15-year veteran of law enforcement, walked to the driver’s side of the car to make contact with a man sitting in the driver’s seat, and his partner walked toward the woman. The deputy was less than 10 feet from the car when the driver produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired at him. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The male suspect also fired at the deputy’s partner as he and his accomplice fled in the car. They later abandoned the car, and the male suspect attempted to carjack a vehicle. When the driver of that vehicle refused to exit, the male suspect shot the driver in the face multiple times. He then went to another vehicle, confronted its driver, and took her car at gunpoint. The two suspects drove to another area of the county, where they abandoned the woman’s car. The male suspect then confronted another motorist and took his truck at gunpoint. The pair left the area in the truck and drove to Auburn in Placer County. Multiple Placer County SO patrol units responded to the area. Around 12:30 p.m., the male suspect fired at deputies, abandoned the truck and his female accomplice, and stole a Placer County SO patrol unit. As the suspect drove away, three Placer County SO detectives (one in a lead vehicle and two in a vehicle following behind) approached the scene. The detectives were unaware that the male suspect had stolen the Placer County SO patrol unit, so when they passed the stolen patrol unit heading the opposite direction, they turned their vehicles around and followed it. When the detectives arrived at the end of the road, they saw the patrol unit they had followed parked in a driveway. The detective in the lead vehicle parked about 40 feet from the driveway. The detective driving the second vehicle parked to the right of the lead detective’s vehicle. A Placer County SO deputy joined the detectives at the scene in his marked patrol unit and parked about 40 feet behind the detectives’ vehicles.", "id.num": 945}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

investigative activity around 6:20 p.m. on December 30. In response to a woman’s complaint that her ex-boyfriend had violated a Protection From Abuse (PFA) court order, the trooper, who had 1 year of law enforcement experience, went to the man’s residence to question him. According to the complaint, the man had allegedly left several gifts inside the woman’s vehicle at her place of employment, which violated the no-contact clause of the PFA order. The trooper, who was wearing body armor, entered the residence, began questioning the man, and then asked him to step outside onto the porch to discuss the matter further. According to the subject’s mother, who was in the residence at the time, the man asked the trooper if he could get a cigarette from his bedroom before they went outside. The man went to his bedroom, and the trooper met him in the hallway as he came out. They proceeded to exit the residence, first the trooper and then the man, with the man’s mother following behind. As they exited, the man’s mother saw her son pull a weapon from his waistband area, and she yelled at him. The trooper turned, and the subject shot the trooper in the head with a .32-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The victim trooper was fatally wounded in both the front and rear of his head. The subject’s mother then fled the scene with her boyfriend, who had been in the basement and reported the shooting. The subject later fled the scene on foot before authorities could apprehend him. Around 9:45 a.m. the next day, as members of the PSP Special Emergency Response Team were clearing the crime scene, members of the PSP Troop G worked to clear nearby structures and found the subject hiding in an unoccupied camper approximately ¼ mile from the scene. Upon making verbal contact with the suspect, troopers could not get him to comply with their commands. When the suspect made a move to come out of the camper toward the troopers with a firearm in his right hand, he was justifiably killed. The 32-year-old offender, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record which included a violent crime.", "id.num": 3}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

with the Glendale Police Department was shot and killed while assisting another officer with a vehicle stop on February 19. Around 7:30 a.m., the 24-year-old police officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience, responded to back up the primary officer, who had stopped a car with no license plate. After detaining the driver in the back seat of his patrol car for a misdemeanor warrant, the primary officer approached the car again near the passenger door while the backup officer covered from the rear of the vehicle. Without notice, the front seat passenger exited the car and spun around to face the officer at the rear of the vehicle. As he did so, he drew a .357 Magnum revolver from his waistband and immediately fired at the backup officer, who was wearing body armor, and fatally hit the officer in the right side of his head. The primary officer fired at the suspect and then radioed dispatch. The assailant quickly moved away from the scene while shooting at the primary officer. As the primary officer went for cover, he fired again and hit the suspect in the right knee, instantly knocking him to the ground. The primary officer continued to watch the suspect and attempted to protect the victim officer by moving him to the closest point of cover behind the wheel of a parked car.

was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack as he was on patrol and stopped at the scene of a vehicle crash. The deputy, with almost 6 years of law enforcement experience, was driving his patrol vehicle when the driver of a truck that had pulled in behind him at an intersection accelerated into oncoming traffic and passed the marked patrol vehicle. The driver of the truck pulled alongside the vehicle in front of the deputy and turned sharply into the vehicle, forcing it to the curb. The veteran deputy, who was wearing body armor, pulled his patrol vehicle over between the two vehicles, activated his lights, and began to report the accident over his radio. His report stopped in midsentence as the driver of the truck exited his vehicle and began shooting a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the deputy as he sat in his patrol vehicle. The shooter fired a total of 11 rounds, striking the deputy in the front of the head, as well as the hood and windshield of the deputy’s vehicle and a nearby house. Before suffering the fatal wound, the deputy drew his weapon, and fired one round at the suspect but missed. It was subsequently learned that the shooter was the estranged husband of the woman driving the other vehicle, and that she had a restraining order against him. After shooting the deputy, the man walked to the car in which the woman was now cowering on the floor, and he began shouting at her to look at him. The 27-year-old shooter, who had a prior criminal record of violent crime, then committed suicide with a single shot to the head. The woman called 911 as a nearby witness to the crime tried to render aid to the deputy. Backup officers and emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene. The deputy was transported to a local medical center where he died from his wound the next day.", "id.num": 1188}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826825Z", "updated_at":

The deputy and officers drew their weapons and ordered the man several times to put down the weapon, telling him they were there to help. The man walked into the street in front of the deputy’s patrol unit and began to walk toward the vehicle with the firearm in his hands. He then raised his arms and fired the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the officers. The deputy returned fire with his rifle. One round from the assailant’s weapon struck the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the front lower torso/stomach below his body armor. The victim deputy took cover at the back of his patrol unit, and he and responding BPD officers continued to return fire, striking the suspect several times. The victim deputy was taken by ambulance, then by helicopter, to a hospital for treatment. The deputy recovered from his injuries and has since returned to duty.

around 7:45 p.m. on October 9 at the university’s police station while he was processing an individual suspected of firing a weapon in a dormitory. Earlier in the day, around 3:30 p.m., the officer, who had 5 months of law enforcement experience, arrived at a Texas Tech University (TTU) dormitory suite with another officer to investigate a reported odor of marijuana. The officers knocked on the suite door; however, no one answered, so they left. Approximately 2 hours later, the officer and a different backup officer went to the student union building and met with two TTU students, who lived in the same suite the officers had been to earlier. The students reported one of their suitemates had discharged a firearm inside his dorm room around 2 a.m. that morning. The officers returned to the dormitory suite to conduct a welfare check shortly before 6 p.m. They entered the dorm room and saw evidence of drug use and a pellet pistol in plain view, but the student who lived in the room was not there. The officers were collecting the items in plain sight when the student returned. Based on the visible evidence in the room, the officers searched the student, handcuffed him, and transported him to the TTU police station. In the briefing room, the officer was completing the paperwork required to transport the student to the Lubbock County Jail. The student requested to use the restroom, and the officer removed the handcuffs. The student attempted to enter a private restroom stall but was not allowed to do so. The student was escorted back to the briefing room and sat back down next to the officer, who was wearing body armor. Without warning, the student produced a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his pants and fired one round, mortally wounding the officer in the right side of his head. The suspect then fled the police station on foot. Officers set up a containment perimeter and took the suspect into custody less than 2 hours later. The 19-year-old suspect, who had a previous arrest for an alcohol violation, was known to possess a controlled substance and alcohol. He was arrested and charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.", "id.num": 449}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826888Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T04:35:15.225090Z",

with the West Columbia Police Department (WCPD) was wounded while answering a call for backup. A short time earlier, a WCPD officer responded to a report of an impaired man in a vehicle. The officer parked his patrol unit next to the man’s vehicle and approached the driver’s side door. The subject placed his vehicle in reverse, and the vehicle rolled backwards onto an adjacent street. The officer took hold of the side mirror and stopped the rolling vehicle. The subject was fidgeting and yelling, so the officer asked him what was wrong. The man ignored the officer and continued his erratic behavior. The officer asked the man to exit the vehicle, but the subject did not comply and stated he needed to make a phone call because he was out of gas. Tinted windows prevented the officer from seeing clearly inside the vehicle, so he called for backup. The corporal, who had nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, and two additional WCPD officers arrived at the scene. When one of the newly arrived officers opened the driver’s door of the vehicle, the man grabbed a 4-inch knife and held it to his own throat. The man stated that he had been released from prison recently, and he was concerned the officers were going to take him back to jail. The subject repeated that he wanted to make a call, so one of the officers offered to make the call if the man would put down the knife. Once again, the subject ignored the officer and continued to rant and complain. A WCPD sergeant arrived at the scene and asked the man what was wrong; he replied that the officers were trying to take him back to jail. During their conversation, the subject placed the knife on the vehicle seat. While distracting the man by talking to him, the sergeant passed his electronic control device behind his back to one of the other officers. At that point, the sergeant and two of the officers reached inside the vehicle and attempted to pull the man out. The subject pulled away, regained the knife, and started swinging it at the officers as he shouted, “Shoot me!” During the scuffle, the corporal, who was wearing body armor, sustained a cut on his left arm/hand near his palm. The suspect closed the vehicle door, so one of the officers used a baton to break the window. The sergeant ordered the suspect to drop the knife; the suspect tossed it out of the window onto the ground. The sergeant then ordered the suspect to exit the vehicle with his hands visible and to get on the ground. Again, the suspect complied. The officers detained the suspect without further incident and took him into custody. The 40-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had prior arrests that included a weapons violation and a violent crime. He was arrested and charged with Public Disorderly Conduct, Unlawful Weapon, and Assault on a Police Officer While Resisting Arrest. The corporal has since recovered from his injury and returned to duty.", "id.num": 1142}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826922Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T04:37:38.319953Z", "inner_id": 101, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19169, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97057362, "annotations": [{"id": 32869491, "completed_by": {"id": 19169, "email": "lucyingram@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "yd2Xv4YOEg", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 13, "text": "11 a.m", "start": 7, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "OkYq7KA6F3", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 168, "text": "handgun ", "start": 160, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "PZUqhK3WkF", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 450, "text": " narcotics", "start": 440, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "5abWTvecfC", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Suspect", "Killed"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-18T04:38:08.244943Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T04:38:08.244959Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-18T04:37:47.256907Z", "lead_time": 29.241, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "6cea78cb-e1a4-4280-97bc-49f3660577ad", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057362, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19169, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19169}, {"id": 32816804, "completed_by": {"id": 19148, "email": "anaislauper@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "EVUjdkJzCq", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 13, "text": " 11 a.m", "start": 6, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "3-byED2YJn", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 167, "text": "handgun", "start": 160, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "3c0dyIjINJ", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 450, "text": " influence of narcotics", "start": 427, "labels": ["Drugs"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "VeYtdD2hqs", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Suspect", "Killed"], ["Situation", "Encounter"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-16T23:22:12.190631Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-16T23:22:12.190651Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-16T23:20:45.307197Z", "lead_time": 98.14, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "e29ba1df-3c2d-4957-9348-fcf8a01af032", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057362, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19148, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19148}], "file_upload": "f3d2399a-data8.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 61.115424430641816, "data": {"text": "Around 11 a.m., heavy equipment was used to remove portions of the house and a robot was used to inspect the attic.

sheriff was injured in an ambush in Tallahassee. Both deputies, who were with the Leon County Sheriff’s Office, arrived at the scene of a house fire about the same time. The 47-year-old deputy, a law enforcement veteran with more than 18 years’ experience, exited his vehicle, began walking toward the fire, and was immediately ambushed by gunfire. The man who lived at the burning residence shot the veteran deputy with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, fatally striking the front and side of the deputy’s head. The veteran deputy, who was wearing body armor, died at the scene of the incident. The assailant also fired on the 33-year-old deputy, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience. Firefighters began arriving on scene and took cover while the surviving deputy exchanged gunfire with the assailant. In the meantime, an off-duty police officer with the Tallahassee Police Department (Tallahassee PD) was in his home when he heard the gunfire. The officer secured his family in place and left to investigate. By the time the officer arrived at the fire, the surviving deputy had taken cover after being shot in the rear upper torso/back (the round struck the deputy’s protective vest). The officer and the deputy looked for the assailant as they moved to another position of cover. About that time, another Tallahassee PD officer who arrived attempted to render aid to the fallen veteran deputy, but he advised over the radio that the deputy was deceased. The assailant fired on that officer, and the officer used his patrol unit as cover. The first Tallahassee PD officer, the one who arrived on the scene from his home, was then able to locate, shoot, and justifiably kill the 53-year-old assailant. The assailant, who had a prior criminal record and was under the influence of narcotics, fired 28 rounds during the incident. The wounded deputy has since recovered from his injury and returned to duty.", "id.num": 661}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.826981Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T04:40:13.231285Z",

detective with the Tulare County Sheriff’s Department (TCSD) was shot and killed in Ivanhoe while investigating a suspicious person. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement was traveling southbound when he observed a vehicle parked alongside the road headed in the opposite direction. The detective made a U-turn, drove up to the vehicle, and spoke with the occupants. During this encounter, the detective spotted a man in a nearby orange orchard. He released the vehicle and advised dispatch that he was going to investigate the suspicious man in the orchard. The detective approached the man, talked to him, then the two walked out of the orchard toward the detective’s vehicle. The man pulled out a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired five shots at the detective, who suffered wounds to his stomach, chest, and front of his head. After the shooting, the man walked northbound alongside the road. A number of people driving by the scene used their in- vehicle communications systems and mobile telephones to contact dispatch for assistance. An off-duty nurse, who had witnessed the incident, stopped to provide first aid. A firefighter, who also had witnessed the event, and a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol, who had responded to the report of an officer down, also attempted to assist the wounded detective. Additional units from the TCSD were en route to the scene when a description of the suspect, based on the witness reports, was broadcasted. A sheriff’s sergeant responding to the area arrested the suspect just north of the crime scene. The victim detective was taken to a local hospital where he died later that day from the head wound.

was sitting in his cruiser in the parking lot of a local department store. The officer, who had nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, was completing paperwork when, according to witnesses as well as a security camera on-site, a vehicle pulled along the passenger side of the officer’s patrol car. The driver then lowered his window and shot the victim officer, who was wearing body armor, in the rear of the head with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. The shooter then exited his vehicle, opened the patrol car door, and took the victim officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic duty pistol. The man returned to his car and drove away from the scene. The officer died the next day. The incident was subsequently profiled on a national television show. Shortly thereafter, acting on a tip received, officers and federal agents located the suspect in Jacksonville, Florida, on July 25. During a raid of the residence where he was hiding, the 33-year-old assailant used the victim officer’s weapon to commit suicide.", "id.num": 590}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.827041Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T05:06:26.922032Z", "inner_id": 105, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19169, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97057366, "annotations": [{"id": 32870951, "completed_by": {"id": 19169, "email": "lucyingram@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "UWsDWZ1KCn", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 15, "text": "midnight", "start": 7, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "seER2pPmrf", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 72, "text": "law enforcement officer", "start": 49, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "NKxZI1_peb", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 104, "text": "27 years of experience", "start": 82, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "tQFKzGdTEH", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Assignment", "Traffic stop"], ["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Suspect", "Escaped"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "cb95Llcq1o", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1237, "text": " .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun", "start": 1203, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "L6GC2ZyAA1", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1663, "text": ".40 caliber semiautomatic handgun", "start": 1630, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-18T05:08:51.306423Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T05:08:51.306447Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-18T05:07:12.434527Z", "lead_time": 143.746, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "346eaa92-e728-4f4b-8894-98f335e32d15", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057366, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19169, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19169}, {"id": 32816936, "completed_by": {"id": 19148, "email": "anaislauper@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "15QGVSPPQD", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 15, "text": "midnight", "start": 7, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Hn6u3ArjVM", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 72, "text": " law enforcement officer", "start": 48, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "rzPkyXqmf3", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 104, "text": "27 years of experience", "start": 82, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "_vQCMDem5L", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 130, "text": "another officer", "start": 115, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "8akqHV2MV8", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Assignment", "Traffic stop"], ["Situation", "Encounter"], ["Situation", "Ambush"], ["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Situation", "Pursuit"], ["Suspect", "Escaped"], ["Suspect", "Arrested"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "9sMacjBI-E", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1237, "text": ".22-caliber semiautomatic handgun", "start": 1204, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "Koxk294Fx-", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1663, "text": ".40 caliber semiautomatic handgun", "start": 1630, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-16T23:40:09.469422Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-16T23:40:09.469439Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-16T23:37:01.530725Z", "lead_time": 197.685, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "3a16e9db-c0fe-49de-8bb6-a82bda2ad809", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057366, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19148, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19148}], "file_upload": "f3d2399a-data8.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 69.64577497665734, "data": {"text": "Around midnight on a winter night in the West, a law enforcement officer, who had 27 years of experience, assisted another officer with a traffic stop. The second officer arrested the driver of the vehicle for DUI and transported  him in a police unit for processing. The assisting officer stayed on scene to oversee the impounding of the subject's vehicle. A tow truck arrived, and the operator began prepping the offender's vehicle for towing. About this time, the officer observed a male subject walking down the sidewalk in their direction. The subject approached the  tow truck driver and began questioning him about the vehicle being towed. When the officer heard the subject's heated questions, he exited his patrol vehicle, approached the man, and asked him if he could help with anything. The man replied in a loud, aggressive tone as he walked out of sight. The officer began filling out an impound form, which included an inventory of the vehicle's contents. The tow truck driver acted as a witness for the contents.  As the officer and tow truck driver were involved in the inventory process, the man returned, approached them from behind, and shot the officer in the back of the head with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The officer took cover around the other side of the tow truck as the offender attempted to flee. The unarmed tow truck driver began chasing the offender down the street. The offender shot at the driver, so the driver stopped and hurried back to the officer to tell him that the offender was returning. The officer maintained a position of cover and fired two rounds at the offender with his .40 caliber semiautomatic handgun. Although the rounds did not strike the offender, they caused him to flee. An assisting officer arrived on scene and transported the victim officer in a patrol car to the hospital. The officer was treated and released from the hospital after 4 days with additional medical care to follow. Two days later, an extensive investigation and search for the 49-year-old offender ended successfully. The offender was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison.", "id.num": 1244}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.827070Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T05:08:51.386446Z", "inner_id":

were killed and another of its officers was injured during a traffic stop and related tactical situation on March 21.

A 41-year-old officer, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, had just cleared a traffic stop one block away and drove to the sergeant’s location. The lone occupant of the vehicle that the sergeant had stopped presented false identification. The sergeant and the officer were walking toward the vehicle on the driver’s side when the occupant of the vehicle opened fire with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun through the open window on the driver’s side. Both officers, though wearing protective body armor, were each fatally struck in the neck. The victim officers were transported to a local hospital where they succumbed to their injuries. A SWAT team was assembled to search for the suspect, who had fled from the scene. At 3:02 p.m., the tactical team entered the apartment of the suspect’s sister, where they had tracked him. As a 43-year-old sergeant with 13 years of law enforcement experience and a 35-year-old sergeant with 9 years of law enforcement experience entered the apartment, they were shot by the suspect with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. Both victim sergeants were wearing body armor, and both were shot fatally in the fronts of their heads. The suspect retreated to a rear bedroom. As a 33-year-old sergeant, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, entered that room, he was shot in the front upper torso/chest above his protective vest. He was transported to a local hospital where he was treated and released. The other sergeants were transported to the hospital where they were pronounced dead.

unprovoked attack. Shortly before 10 p.m., officers had responded to a shooting at a restaurant and found two men critically injured. While the officers were on the scene, a second call was received regarding a shooting about two blocks away from the first incident. Soon after, a uniformed officer made visual contact with the suspect of both shootings. The suspect was in a stolen vehicle; a high-speed chase began and reached well over 100 miles per hour. The suspect was headed toward a crowded intersection known for its foot traffic. The 46-year-old officer, a veteran with nearly 18 years of law enforcement experience, heard the radio transmission regarding the chase. He ran to the intersection and was clearing the street of pedestrians when he was fatally struck by the suspect’s speeding vehicle. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, suffered multiple injuries. The officer was taken to a local hospital where he died. The suspect continued to flee until he crashed the vehicle. A brief foot pursuit and struggle followed, which resulted in responding officers using an electronic control weapon on the 21-year-old suspect. The suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a violent crime and weapons violation, was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder, Vehicular Homicide, three counts of Criminal Attempt First-Degree Murder, Reckless Driving, Theft of Property ($10,000 to $60,000), and Intentionally Evading Arrest in a Motor Vehicle.", "id.num": 44}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

When he arrived at the scene and entered the house, the officer found two men arguing. The homeowner was attempting to detain the second man, the burglary suspect. The officer approached the men and identified himself. The burglar ran from the house, followed by both the officer and the homeowner. The officer chased the burglary suspect and ordered him to stop, but he did not comply. The officer, who was wearing body armor, eventually caught up to the burglary suspect, and the two struggled and wrestled on the ground. The homeowner caught up to the pair, produced his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and pointed it in the direction of the officer and the burglary suspect. The homeowner fired a single round at close range; the bullet struck the officer in the arms/hands. The burglary suspect got up and ran to an area behind the home. Additional officers arrived at the scene and took the burglary suspect into custody. Officers at the scene also arrested the 30-year-old homeowner, who knew the victim officer from a prior relationship through law enforcement (arrests, investigations, etc.).

He also drove directly into the path of oncoming deputies’ vehicles, causing the deputies to take evasive actions to avoid colliding head on. Near Lebanon, at an intersection of the highway on which the suspect was traveling, the sergeant parked his vehicle and attempted to deploy a tire-deflation device. When the vehicle approached the sergeant’s location, the driver veered off of the highway and struck the sergeant. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, suffered multiple injuries and was killed instantly. Within seconds of the incident, additional units arrived at the scene and found the victim sergeant. However, they were unable to locate the suspect. Air support and K-9 units were brought in to assist with the search for the suspect. Around 6:15 a.m., K-9 units tracking the suspect helped a deputy locate the man and take him into custody. The 22-year-old suspect was charged with Murder, Involuntary Manslaughter, Aggravated Vehicular Homicide, Receiving Stolen Property, Failure to Comply with an Order or Signal of a Law Enforcement Officer, two counts of Felonious Assault, and two counts of Having Weapons While Under Disability.

11 a.m., a 53-year-old deputy sheriff with the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Department was shot and killed in an ambush while attempting to serve a civil eviction notice in Modesto. The veteran deputy, with 17 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at an apartment building with another deputy and a locksmith in order to evict the resident of one of the apartments. After repeatedly trying to contact the resident without success, the deputy directed the locksmith to drill the lock of the apartment’s front door so they could gain entry. The locksmith knelt in front of the door and began drilling the lock, pausing briefly when he thought he heard movement inside the apartment. When nothing further was heard, he resumed drilling. Just as the locksmith resumed his work, the suspect shot several rounds in rapid succession through the door with a 7.62x39 mm automatic rifle. The locksmith was struck once in the front upper torso/chest and fell, mortally wounded. The deputy was struck five times in the front lower torso/stomach and the front upper torso/chest with rounds that penetrated his body armor, and once, fatally, in the side of his head. The second deputy, who was standing just west of the front door returned fire and then retreated to a corner of the apartment building and called for help on his radio. In a short time, more than 150 law enforcement officers from local, state, and federal agencies responded to the heavily populated residential area and began evacuating people to safety. The suspect barricaded himself in his apartment and refused all attempts at communication. Information was provided indicating the suspect, who had prior military training, was heavily armed with high-powered weapons, armor-piercing ammunition, explosives, body armor, and a gas mask. He also had a cinder block bunker in his residence. For six hours, law enforcement officers attempted to negotiate an end to the standoff. During attempted negotiations, a fire started in the building, which burned for the next four hours and completely demolished the entire structure. After the fire was extinguished, a crime scene investigation began. The 45-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record, was eventually located barricaded in the bathroom. An autopsy determined the suspect died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.", "id.num": 775}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.827327Z", "updated_at":

The investigator, who had nearly 8 years of law enforcement experience, and a detective had traveled there to arrest the subject on drug-related charges. The individual had previously agreed to cooperate with an ongoing drug investigation that the Greene County Sheriff’s Office was conducting but later decided not to cooperate. The deputies arrived at the home of the subject’s mother, who informed them that her son was not there. The deputies asked her if they could search the residence, and she agreed. Once inside the house, the deputies saw the subject go into one of the bedrooms and followed him to the room. One of the deputies kicked open the bedroom door, and the man opened fire on them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. As they returned fire, the man shot the sergeant investigator at least five times in the front below the waist and fatally in the stomach area. The victim deputy was wearing body armor, but the rounds entered between the side panels of the vest.

p.m. on February 7, a master deputy sheriff with the Marion County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed during an unprovoked attack in Ocala. The 36-year-old deputy, who had more than 9 years of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to conduct a well-being check on an individual. The family member who requested the check reported that the man possessed a firearm. Although the veteran deputy, who was wearing body armor, was assigned as backup, he was the first on the scene. He tried unsuccessfully to talk to the man, who remained inside his home. Meanwhile, other officers had arrived at the scene and were assisting the master deputy when the man fired two shots from a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun from inside the house, striking the master deputy at close range in the torso and fatally in the neck. As fellow deputies tried to remove the victim officer from the scene, other officers repeatedly commanded the shooter to surrender. The man refused to comply with the officers’ demands. When the officers made physical contact with the man, he grabbed the barrel of a deputy’s shotgun. The suspect was subsequently shot and killed. The 74-year-old man had prior mental disorders.

The officer, who had nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, went to the residence of a man known to the Navajo Nation PD for previous domestic disturbance and public intoxication calls. At 11:57 p.m., a female civilian used the officer’s radio to request an ambulance for an injured officer. Several officers responded to the call within minutes and found the victim officer lying along the road with a gunshot wound in the front of his head above his right eye. He was breathing but unresponsive. He had been struck with a round from a .22-caliber rifle. Officers removed the wounded officer’s body armor to check for other injuries and found a bruise on the right side of his abdomen. Emergency services personnel transported the wounded officer to a local fire department. From there he was airlifted to a hospital in Albuquerque where he succumbed to his injuries on March 12. As the officers searched for the suspect, they received a report that, at the suspect’s request, a man who lived near the scene had given him a ride and dropped him off near his residence. At approximately 9 a.m. on March 12, the suspect was found hiding between rocks and a hillside less than a mile south of his residence. The 32-year-old suspect was complaining of pain in his back and arms. He was taken to a local hospital then transported to the local jail where he was charged with Criminal Homicide, Aggravated Battery, Unlawful Carrying of a Deadly Weapon, Unlawful Use of a Weapon, and Tampering with Physical Evidence.

March 19, a supervisor with the First Judicial District (FJD) of Pennsylvania was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a man in Philadelphia. The 53-year-old supervisor with 8½ years of law enforcement experience, an FJD investigator, and two officers with the FBI’s Philadelphia Violent Crimes/Fugitive Task Force went to the apartment of a man wanted on Rape and Drug Violations. The task force officers requested assistance from the Philadelphia Police Department, which sent two officers to the scene who covered the alley behind the apartment. One of the task force officers knocked on the apartment’s front door and indicated their identities to the occupants. Several seconds later, a woman inside the apartment opened the door and told the officers that the man they were looking for was in the bedroom. The officers entered the poorly lit apartment, and as the woman stepped into the kitchen, the man opened fire on the officers with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. One of the bullets struck the supervisor in the stomach below his protective vest, and he fell to the floor. Despite his injury, the supervisor was able to fire 15 shots, but apparently none of those shots hit the offender. As they backed out of the apartment along with the other task force officer, the investigator was shot in the stomach and one of the task force officers was struck in the left hand. The officers then heard two shots from inside the apartment. The task force officers attempted to come to the aid of the supervisor, but when they tried to reenter the apartment, the suspect opened fire on them again. They returned fire and shot the suspect in his back and leg. One of the officers called for backup from the Philadelphia Police Department and numerous officers, including the officers who had been covering the rear of the apartment building, swarmed to the front of the building. The suspect climbed out of a rear window in the apartment and broke into the apartment directly below. The responding officers searched the man’s apartment, but failed to find him. Philadelphia Police Department SWAT officers located a blood trail in the man’s apartment and followed it to the apartment below, where they found and arrested him. The FJD supervisor was taken to a local hospital where he died from two gunshot wounds to the back of his head. The 40-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included arrests for Murder, Rape, Robbery, and Aggravated Assault, was transported to a local hospital where he was treated for his wounds. He was charged with First-Degree Murder, 3 counts of Attempted Murder, 3 counts of Aggravated Assault, and Firearms Violations. Shortly before 11:30 a.m. on March 31, two deputy sheriffs with the Bradford County Sheriff’s Office were shot and killed in an ambush in the city of Gillett while they were attempting to serve a failure-to- appear warrant on a known drug dealer. The two deputies went to the home of the man’s father, which had an auto junkyard behind it and was located in a heavily wooded area, in an attempt to locate the subject. The deputies knocked on the front door of the residence, but no one answered. They then went around the house to the junkyard. The man, who had prior arrests that include Assault on a Police Officer and Weapons Violations, is believed to have hidden among the cars and fired 3 shots from a .38- caliber handgun at the deputies. The 36-year-old veteran deputy with 9 years of service in law enforcement was struck in the neck and died instantly. The 30-year-old deputy with 4½ years in law enforcement was mortally wounded in the stomach by a bullet that entered his protective vest between the side panels. The suspect’s father heard the gunshots and found the officers. The wounded officer was able to ask him to call for help. The father went to his house and telephoned the sheriff’s office to inform them that one officer was dead and another wounded. When the medical personnel arrived, they determined that both deputies were dead. Not being certain of the identity or location of the shooter, they retreated from the scene. When the backup officers arrived, they were unable to locate the suspect on the property or determine how he was traveling. Law enforcement personnel from Pennsylvania and New York launched a massive search involving hundreds of officers. The officers set up roadblocks, searched for the suspect from the air by helicopter, and looked for the man in the wooded areas using K-9 units and tactical teams. The next day, an officer in a helicopter spotted the suspect walking on a road a few miles from his father’s house. Officers on the ground took him into custody without further incident. The 27-year-old man was charged with two counts each of First-Degree Murder and Third-Degree Murder.", "id.num": 683}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.827568Z", "updated_at":

a.m. on June 19. The officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 27 ½ years of experience, responded to a call reporting a man with a firearm. The officer arrived on the scene at 9:24 a.m. and observed an armed individual arguing with a woman (who was later identified as the individual’s mother). The officer was familiar with the individual and his mother from patrolling the neighborhood. The officer drew his conductive energy device and ordered the individual to show his hands. The individual moved toward the officer and drew a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his waistband. The officer then removed his weapon, a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. The individual fired four rounds at the officer, three of which struck the officer in the arms/hands and in the front lower torso/stomach between the side panels of the body armor he was wearing. The officer fell into the street; he and the suspect wrestled briefly before the suspect gained control of the victim officer’s weapon and used it to fire at a probation officer who had arrived on the scene. The suspect then demanded that the probation officer kill him. Another officer arrived, and the suspect and that officer engaged in a gun battle around the officer’s car. The responding officer shot the suspect, killing him. The victim officer was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced deceased; the fatal wound was to his front lower torso/stomach.

a.m., a 28-year-old deputy sheriff and a 38-year-old sergeant with the Del Norte County Sheriff’s Office (DNCSO) were stabbed and injured while answering a disturbance call in Crescent City. A woman called dispatch and reported her roommate was in her room yelling at her. The deputy sheriff, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence and was met at the front door by the roommate, who let the deputy in. Once inside, the deputy turned on his body camera and then spoke with both roommates about the dispute. The man was primarily upset that the woman had turned off the internet service. The woman wanted the man to move out of the residence. After hearing both accounts, the deputy determined the matter was civil in nature and not criminal, but he tried to offer a resolution by suggesting the man leave the residence for a while. The deputy offered the man a ride, but the man did not want to leave without his cats. He tried to call a friend to come get him, but the friend did not answer the phone. The man told the deputy he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and repeatedly said that he would hurt his roommate if he remained there. Based on these recurring statements, the deputy determined the man should be placed in protective custody. The deputy asked if he would speak to mental health workers, and the man declined. During their interactions, the deputy saw what he thought was a rifle inside the residence and a sheathed knife on the man. Around 9:20 a.m., the deputy radioed for backup using a code indicating weapons were present. When the sergeant, an 11-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived at the residence at 9:29 a.m., the deputy had the man step outside. As the sergeant, who was also wearing a body camera, approached, the deputy reiterated the statements the man had told him so the sergeant could ascertain the seriousness of the situation. The deputy asked the man about the rifle and knife he observed in the residence; the man said it was a pellet gun and admitted he had a knife. The deputy told the man they were going to take him into custody for a mental health evaluation and began to move near him. The subject began yelling repeatedly that he did not want to deal with “mental health in this county.” The officers ordered him not to reach for anything and repeatedly told him to put his hands behind his head; however, he refused to comply. As the officers talked to the subject in an attempt to calm him, the subject said that someone was coming to pick him up and that he would leave his roommate alone. The subject then advised the officers he was going to reach for his phone. The sergeant warned the subject that reaching for anything would result in a firearm being pointed at him. The sergeant again implored the subject to place his hands on the back of his head. The subject then put his hand on his knife, so the deputy pointed his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun toward the man and notified dispatch “one at gunpoint.” The officers continued to command the subject to put his hands on his head, and at one point the subject replied, “No! You’re going to have to shoot.” Around 9:34 a.m., the sergeant moved toward the subject in an effort to subdue him; the subject pulled his knife from its sheath. The deputy called dispatch again for backup. The sergeant attempted to control the subject’s hands, but he maneuvered the knife and stabbed the sergeant on the top of both hands and wrists. The sergeant lost his grip, and the deputy then engaged in a physical confrontation with the subject, attempting to pull him down. As the officers tried to gain control of the subject, he turned and stabbed the sergeant in the left side of his back. The blade penetrated the sergeant’s uniform and partially penetrated his ballistic vest; the body armor prevented the blade from piercing the sergeant’s skin. The subject turned and attacked the deputy with the knife, resulting in a 6-inch cut on the left side of the deputy’s head. The subject fell to the ground but got back up and rushed several feet toward the deputy, who attempted to pull his weapon and stand up before the subject reached him. The subject tried to stab the deputy in his lower left chest; however, the deputy backed up and the subject cut the deputy’s shirt cuff. The subject again turned toward the sergeant, who had drawn his duty weapon and was attempting to get to his feet as the subject raised the knife above his head. The subject was almost on top of the sergeant when the sergeant fired his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded subject fell to the ground. The sergeant also fell to the ground. The deputy, who was approximately 10 feet from the subject, noticed the subject was trying to get up, so he fired three rounds from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, further incapacitating the subject. At 9:35 a.m., the sergeant told dispatchers that shots were fired, an officer was down, and medical attention was needed. The sergeant and deputy ordered the subject, who had risen to his hands and knees, to stay down, but he continued to disregard commands. The subject laid down, but continued roll around. The deputy readied his electronic control device and retrieved the knife from the ground near the subject’s feet. At about 9:38 a.m., law enforcement officers began arriving on scene. A police officer with the Crescent City Police Department placed the subject in handcuffs. Ambulance crews arrived and began treating the deputy and the subject, who were both taken to a local hospital by ambulance. The sergeant was taken to a local hospital by DNCSO deputies. The deputy received 10 staples in his head, and the sergeant received three stitches in his hand. They were released from the hospital and have returned to duty. The 38-year-old subject succumbed to his injuries later that day. The subject, who was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime.", "id.num": 139}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

citizen who reported an unresponsive, pregnant female in a nearby garage and blood in the driveway. The caller did not know if the woman was in labor or if it was another issue. Both officers were wearing body cameras, which recorded the incident. Around 10:45 a.m., the two officers arrived at the residence named in the complaint. The garage door was closed, but the officers were able to look inside and see a woman lying on the floor. Unable to gain entry through the garage, the officers went to the front door of the home. With their firearms in their holsters, the officers decided to perform a forced entry to render aid to the female. The 33-year-old officer, who was a 9-year veteran of law enforcement, kicked down the door, and he was immediately met with gunfire from inside the home. The officer was hit in the front below the waist/groin area and front upper torso/chest, but his body armor prevented the bullet from striking him. Despite his blunt-force trauma injuries, the officer was able to make it into the garage. The other officer retreated outside, and the offender continued to shoot at him through a front window. Other officers responded to the scene while the suspect continued to fire rounds. One of the backup officers kicked out the door panels of the garage, allowing the injured officer to escape. Officers set up a perimeter around the house and were awaiting SWAT when the offender yelled out the window that he had a hostage. A few minutes later, the offender fired a shot that struck the other officer who was first to arrive at the scene. The 32-year-old officer, who was also wearing body armor, was struck in his arms/hands. The 7-year veteran of law enforcement was able to crawl to a tree for cover. The 47-year-old offender, who used both a .38-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a 9 mm handgun, eventually killed his juvenile hostage before committing suicide. The woman in the garage also died. The offender had prior arrests for aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, resisting arrest, and a weapons violation. Both officers were taken to a local hospital with critical injuries. The 9-year veteran officer has since returned to duty. The 7-year veteran officer had not returned to duty at the time this incident was reported to the FBI.", "id.num": 188}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.827693Z", "updated_at":

34-year-old trooper first class with the Maryland State Police was stabbed while answering a call for service involving the malicious destruction of property. Around 7 a.m., the trooper, a veteran of law enforcement with 5 years of experience, was dispatched to an address in Westminster. He had been called to the same address the previous day, also regarding the malicious destruction of property. The trooper arrived at the scene at 7:14 a.m. and began speaking with the complainant. At 7:50 a.m., the dispatcher received another report that a suspect in the same area was using a knife to slash tires on a vehicle. Already at the scene, the trooper encountered a subject armed with a knife with a 4.5-inch blade. According to witnesses, the trooper ordered the subject at least five times to drop the knife and attempted to de-escalate the situation for more than 3 minutes. The witnesses said the offender advanced toward the trooper and brandished the knife “like a ninja.” During the ensuing altercation, the trooper was stabbed once on the right side between the side panels of his body armor, sustaining injuries to his front upper torso/chest and rear upper torso/back. The trooper drew his service weapon and fired two rounds, striking the offender with both. The trooper and a witness who was a nurse rendered aid to the offender. He was later transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The trooper was also transported to the hospital, where he was treated and released. He has since returned to duty. Homicide investigators interviewed witnesses and reviewed surveillance video recorded at the time, which was consistent with the witnesses’ reports. They learned that the 34- year-old offender was suffering from a mental illness and was the subject of an emergency petition in 2018.

Because of information gleaned from their long-term investigation, the agents had prior knowledge that the associate of the main subject reportedly possessed multiple firearms and was a heavy methamphetamine user. While traveling to the restaurant, the agents spotted the subject and his associate at a gas station. The agents continued to the meeting place and set up surveillance in and around the restaurant’s parking lot. Eventually, the vehicles belonging to both the subject and the supplier arrived. The main subject who arranged the meeting exited his vehicle and approached the supplier’s vehicle. Multiple agents approached both vehicles on foot, made verbal contact with the subject and the supplier, and ordered the associate, who was in the passenger seat of the subject’s vehicle, to show his hands. By this time, the associate already had his car door open and, without warning, fired two rounds from a .45-caliber revolver in the direction of the agents located at the rear of the vehicle. The second round struck the victim agent, who was wearing body armor, in the front lower torso/stomach. The victim agent fired two rounds from his service weapon at the suspect before falling to the ground; however, both rounds missed the suspect. Other agents fired into the front passenger area of the vehicle, striking and justifiably killing the suspect. The victim agent was transported to a local hospital where he was treated and released a few hours later. The round that struck the victim agent had not penetrated his body armor. The 34-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime and a drug law violation. He was a known drug user, dealer, and possessor, and he was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. The main subject of the investigation and the supplier were taken into custody, uninjured. Subsequent searches of the vehicles revealed a second firearm in the main subject’s vehicle and several pounds of methamphetamine in the supplier’s vehicle. The victim agent recovered from his injury and returned to duty.", "id.num": 1079}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-03-10T18:40:49.827822Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T05:56:51.595158Z", "inner_id": 129, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19169, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 97057390, "annotations": [{"id": 32873451, "completed_by": {"id": 19169, "email": "lucyingram@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "6km92Du8S4", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 16, "text": "9:30 p.m.", "start": 7, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "6UYL_szXQL", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 120, "text": "15 and 7 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 76, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "sroUxixw__", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 408, "text": ".308 SKS rifle", "start": 394, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "VrKQRHr-28", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Suspect", "Suicide"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-18T05:57:45.674807Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T05:57:45.674825Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-18T05:57:02.135829Z", "lead_time": 53.428, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "5f0ffb11-5c22-46da-94fd-f4f9ce53d6e0", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057390, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19169, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19169}, {"id": 32817730, "completed_by": {"id": 19148, "email": "anaislauper@arizona.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "1LX7I_v-LW", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 16, "text": "9:30 p.m.", "start": 7, "labels": ["Time"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "XKMTucFZOK", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 66, "text": "two officers", "start": 54, "labels": ["Person"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "uVpXZc-t1m", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 33, "text": "autumn", "start": 27, "labels": ["Date"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "6pE8Us9BlQ", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 120, "text": "15 and 7 years of law enforcement experience", "start": 76, "labels": ["Experience"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}, {"id": "udbmO5ZK71", "type": "taxonomy", "value": {"taxonomy": [["Assaulted", "Injured"], ["Assignment", "Citizen call"], ["Assignment", "Investigation"], ["Assignment", "Police call"], ["Situation", "Encounter"], ["Situation", "Pursuit"], ["Suspect", "Suicide"]]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "Category"}, {"id": "KVqx8WKgME", "type": "labels", "value": {"end": 408, "text": " .308 SKS rifle", "start": 393, "labels": ["Firearm"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label"}], "reviews": [], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2024-03-17T01:17:53.421154Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-17T01:17:53.421171Z", "draft_created_at": "2024-03-17T01:16:15.857929Z", "lead_time": 191.164, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "1c95a8ea-d7d2-49c6-9969-b9e508ec8034", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "task": 97057390, "project": 58513, "updated_by": 19148, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 19148}], "file_upload": "f3d2399a-data8.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 43.61904761904762, "data": {"text": "Around 9:30 p.m. on a cool autumn night in the South, two officers, who had 15 and 7 years of law enforcement experience, respectively, responded to a call concerning an active shooter at an apartment complex.
