# Annotations

To conduct the annotations, this project relied on [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/), a web-based annotation interface. 

The coding protocol conted on the support of 36 undergraduate students grouped into 11 teams. Each team classified and annotated 130 LEOKA narratives. The first 30 narratives are common to all teams of coders, while the reminder 100 narratives are unique to each group.

This folder contains the annotations that the coders conducted in Label Studio.


Dr. Osorio extends his gratitude to the Label Studio team for extending a free academic license for this project and to all the University of Arizona students who collaborated in this project.
