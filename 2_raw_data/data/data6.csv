"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault. The suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, turned the handgun on himself and committed suicide. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The K-9 survived its injury.",954
"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290
"A 30-year-old patrol officer with the Sandusky Police Department was shot and killed on March 19 while attempting to make a traffic stop. Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was treated at a nearby hospital, but died from the wound to his upper back from a round that entered through the armhole of his vest.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence. After a standoff of several hours, SWAT officers arrested the alleged shooter without further incident. He was charged with Murder.",196
"On August 12 around 3:40 p.m., a 33-year-old patrol officer with the Hatch Police Department was fatally wounded while making a traffic stop. The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects. The 38-year-old man who allegedly shot the victim officer was charged with Murder, Possession of a Firearm, Firing Weapon, and Carjacking. He was under the influence of narcotics and on probation at the time of the incidents and had a prior criminal record which included a murder. The victim officer was airlifted to a nearby hospital where he died later that day.",798
"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

He had a previous criminal record that included drug violations, violent crime, and weapons violations.",1124
"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest. The deputy was able to fire four rounds from his service weapon, but none of the rounds struck the suspect. Another officer then shot the suspect in the head, killing him instantly. The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The suspect was subsequently found unconscious in his jail cell and later died. The cause of death had not been determined at the time of this report.",624
"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31. The deceased offender was later found to have marijuana and cocaine in a bag tied to his belt and concealed in his clothes.

The suspect was also a registered sex offender.",547
"The veteran officer, with 19 years of law enforcement experience, was off duty and had been visiting his parents immediately prior to the incident under examination. His parents’ home was located across an alley from his residence. As he walked toward his home, he apparently observed not only the reflecting overhead emergency lights of a police vehicle but also a potential suspect in the alley. Unbeknownst to the officer, the suspect was armed and had allegedly stolen a car and robbed a gas station within the previous 20 minutes. Other officers of the Chillicothe Police Department had pursued him and attempted a traffic stop of the stolen vehicle, but the suspect abandoned it and fled down an alley on foot. One of the officers followed the suspect on foot. The suspect then turned down another alley, where he was seen by the off-duty officer. It is believed that the officer transitioned to on-duty status and, unarmed, pursued the suspect. From a distance of less than 5 feet, the suspect fired at the officer with a .38-caliber handgun, striking him in the neck and killing him instantly. Additional officers arrived at the scene and found the body of the victim officer in a dark area of the alley. The officer’s cell phone was found in his right hand, and his personal keys were located next to his left hand. An extensive crime scene search on April 27 resulted in the recovery of a second bullet located in the side paneling of a garage, approximately 220 feet from where the victim officer was shot. The 34-year-old suspect was a known drug user and was on parole at the time of the incident. The man was arrested on April 30; he confessed to the shooting on May 1 and was charged with Aggravated Murder and Aggravated Robbery.",1065
"A 53-year-old police officer with the Whittier Police Department was shot and killed while responding to a motor vehicle crash around 8 a.m. on February 20. The veteran officer, who had 27 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene and parked his marked patrol unit behind one of the vehicles involved in the crash. A 27-year-old backup officer arrived and parked his marked patrol unit in front of the same vehicle. The veteran officer approached the driver, who was in the driver’s seat of the vehicle. The backup officer positioned himself at the vehicle’s front passenger-side door. As the veteran officer returned to the passenger’s side of his patrol unit to retrieve equipment, the backup officer moved to the back of the crashed vehicle to run its license plate number. Dispatch alerted them that the vehicle was stolen, so both officers approached the driver’s side door of the crashed vehicle. The veteran officer asked the driver to step out of the vehicle and face away from him. The driver initially complied, and the officer asked him to place his hands behind his back. Suddenly, the driver retrieved a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from his right rear pants pocket and fired two rounds at the backup officer, who was wearing body armor. One of the rounds struck the backup officer in the front lower torso/abdomen; however, his body armor prevented the round from entering his body. The second round struck and damaged the backup officer’s holstered service weapon as he turned around to seek cover behind his patrol unit. The suspect turned and fired three rounds at the veteran officer. The rounds struck the officer in his arms/hands and fatally in the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. Then, the suspect continued to shoot at the backup officer, who returned fire with one round before his damaged service weapon became inoperable. The suspect moved toward the rear passenger door of the victim officer’s patrol unit. Another officer, who had responded to the other vehicle in the crash, heard the gunfire and ran to the scene. The officer saw the suspect crouched beside the victim officer’s patrol unit holding a handgun and the victim officer on the ground, not moving. The officer fired his service weapon at the suspect, striking him once. After the suspect was hit, he threw his firearm down and surrendered.

"At 12:30 p.m. on February 24, a 37-year-old police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) was assaulted with a knife while handling a person with a mental illness. Earlier that morning, a subject with a diagnosed mental illness and a history of threatening to cut herself with a knife locked herself inside her apartment. A social worker and the subject’s therapist arrived at the subject’s apartment at 9:30 a.m. and requested that she open her door so they could see that she was all right. The social worker and the therapist tried unsuccessfully to get the subject to open her door until around 11 a.m. At that time, they contacted the LAPD for assistance. Initially, two officers arrived and attempted to convince the subject to open her door. When they were unsuccessful, they called for assistance, and a sergeant and six more officers arrived. The officers tried repeatedly for nearly an hour to get the subject to open her door. The sergeant finally gave the order for the officers to breach the subject’s door shortly before noon. The officers disabled the deadbolt and the door knob. The veteran officer, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, attempted to push the door open, but the subject stood on the other side of the door and pushed back against him. Another officer attempted to pry the door open with a crowbar, while the veteran officer continued to push on the door. The subject had a large knife in each hand and slashed the veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, on the right forearm as he pushed the door open. Instead of entering the apartment, the officers allowed the door to close, and they stepped back. They radioed for the SWAT team to assist and, while waiting for the SWAT team to arrive, made further requests to the suspect to exit her apartment. The SWAT team arrived and repeatedly directed the suspect to exit her apartment and submit to arrest. The suspect refused, and the ensuing standoff lasted nearly 6 hours. During that time, officers evacuated the suspect’s neighbors from their apartments and obtained the necessary warrants to arrest the suspect and search her residence. The officers contacted the suspect’s son who eventually persuaded her to exit her residence at 5:20 p.m. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital where he was treated for the wound on his arm and released. The 59-year-old offender, who had no prior criminal record, was charged with Assault with a Deadly Weapon on a Law Enforcement Officer and Resisting a Law Enforcement Officer. The wounded officer recovered from his injuries and returned to duty.",673
"Approximately 10:30 p.m., on November 11, a conservation officer with the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Huntingdon, was shot and killed while investigating reports of illegal poaching of deer near Freedom Township. Upon hearing gunfire in the vicinity, the 31-year-old conservation officer traveled toward the source of the gunfire, where he encountered a pickup with at least two individuals in it. The officer, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience, called dispatch with the license plate of the pickup and requested backup. Before backup officers could arrive, the driver allegedly exited the pickup and approached the officer, who was wearing body armor. When the officer attempted to handcuff the man, a struggle ensued, and there was an exchange of gunfire. The suspect shot the officer in the back of his legs and, fatally, in the back of his neck with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Two of the victim officer’s rounds hit the suspect; another shot was deflected by a knife worn by the man. Apparently, the suspect fled the scene with a handcuff on his right wrist, but he managed to shoot off the handcuff. Shortly after the shooter left the scene, he and a passenger in the pickup went separate ways. When law enforcement personnel later interviewed the passenger, he said that the suspect had illegally shot a deer shortly before the officer arrived, and that the suspect stated that he was “not going back to prison” for possessing a handgun.

The suspect was struck four times by officer fire and subsequently committed suicide with a shot to the head.",323
"On February 10 at 2 p.m., two officers with the Lufkin Police Department (LPD) sustained injuries while answering a call for service to investigate suspicious circumstances. An individual was hiking through the woods near his home and noticed well-traveled paths leading further into the woods to an unusual campsite. The hiker contacted an LPD officer and described what he saw. Two officers responded to the area and followed the trail leading into the woods. The 41-year-old officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 12 years’ experience, felt something puncture the bottom of both of his feet as he walked along. The officer reached through leaves on the trail and discovered several boards with nails driven through them. The boards were buried so that only the nails were above the ground. The officers cautiously continued until they came upon the camp. Although no one was there at the time, it looked like at least one person currently lived there. The officers searched the area but found no evidence of illegal activity. The officers exited the area using a different trail. While leaving, the second officer, who was 33 years old and a veteran officer with 12 years of law enforcement experience, stepped on additional boards with nails in them, causing injuries to his right foot. They carefully exited the area by sliding their feet on the ground to avoid any other traps along the way. The officers were treated for their injuries at a medical facility and released. Around 4:40 p.m. the next day, the second officer and a sergeant with the police department located a possible suspect. Both officers questioned the 31-year-old subject and discovered he was homeless and living at the camp, which was located on private property. The subject admitted to placing spiked boards on the ground to keep others from stealing his possessions and food. A name check found that the subject had two outstanding traffic warrants. Officers performed a body search and found a small bag of marijuana in his pocket. He was taken into custody for the warrants and was later charged with two counts of Assault Causing Bodily Injury and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. The subject had a criminal history including a drug law violation. Both officers returned to duty.",828
"A 56-year-old captain with the Henderson Police Department died December 13 from gunshot wounds sustained shortly before 8 p.m. on December 10 when he responded to a robbery in progress at a local grocery store. Minutes before the incident, one of the employees had called dispatch to report that an armed man was robbing the store. The captain, a veteran with nearly 28 years in law enforcement, and a deputy were the first to arrive at the scene. As two assisting officers were pulling into the store’s parking lot, they received a call from dispatch indicating that shots had been fired in the store and that the captain had been hit.

The 27-year-old officer, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, responded to a residence after dispatchers received a 911 hang-up call. The dispatcher advised that the caller stated he did not trust himself, and then the call was disconnected. Upon arriving at the residence, the man who answered the door informed the officer that he had not called 911 but his adult son may have called. The subject’s mother told the officer her son was outside and very intoxicated. She led the officer into the house, downstairs into the basement, and out to the backyard. The officer observed the subject sitting in a chair crying with his head between his legs. While the officer was questioning him about the 911 call, the man sat up, took a knife from his sweatshirt pocket, and stated, “I cannot take this anymore.” The officer ordered the subject to put the knife down and called for dispatchers to have another unit respond to the location. After the officer again gave orders for the subject to drop the knife, the subject, using his right hand, put the knife to his own throat and began to draw it across his neck. The subject’s mother started to walk toward the subject to stop him, but he ordered her to stay away. The officer, who was wearing body armor, grabbed the man’s right hand and took him to the ground. Once on the ground, the officer gave a final order for the subject to drop the knife, and the subject responded, “I hope you have had some good training if you’re going to get this away from me.” The officer then used chemical spray on the man in an attempt to disarm him; however, the spray seemed to have no effect. While the officer was on top of the subject, the man’s father attempted to assist the officer in removing the knife from his son’s hand. The officer was able to pry the knife away from the subject and throw it off to the side. The officer then secured the suspect in handcuffs, placing his hands behind his back and double locking the cuffs. The officer sustained minor cuts on his left hand during the struggle.

"On August 30, just before noon, a 52-year-old deputy sheriff with the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD) was shot and killed in Sacramento after responding to a call for backup. Three officers with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) were also injured during the incident. Earlier that day, a multijurisdictional, multiagency task force was conducting surveillance on a stolen vehicle in the parking lot of a hotel. As they watched, two individuals entered the vehicle. When task force members attempted a traffic stop, the driver led them on a lengthy pursuit that ended with both individuals being taken into custody. The driver of the vehicle was on searchable probation, so investigators returned to the hotel to conduct a probation search of the room registered to the suspect. Detectives positioned themselves near the entrance and back balcony of the hotel room. As five of the investigators began to push open the door, they were fired upon from inside the room, injuring two of the officers. The investigators took cover and called for backup. The offender fled through the back door of the hotel room from the second story balcony. The SCSD deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with 21 years of experience, responded to the call and arrived during a gun battle between the suspect and the officers in the hotel parking lot. The deputy retrieved his rifle from the rack in his patrol vehicle, took cover behind his vehicle, and attempted to prevent the suspect from fleeing but was struck by a round the suspect fired from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. The round entered above the deputy’s body armor and into his front upper torso/chest, ultimately causing his death. The suspect, who was also armed with three handguns and a grenade, fled the scene in a stolen vehicle with officers in pursuit. The suspect was temporarily forced to a stop by heavy traffic at an intersection. During the stop, the suspect was shot by a pursuing officer. The suspect again fled but lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a pole. Officers took the 32-year-old suspect into custody, and he later died from his wounds. During the incident, three veteran CHP officers were injured: a 43-year-old with 17 years of law enforcement experience, a 42-year-0ld with 11 years of experience, and a 44-year-old with 11 years of experience. All three were transported and admitted to the hospital for treatment of their injuries. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, none of the injured officers had returned to duty. A subsequent search of the hotel room yielded another handgun and a quantity of methamphetamine. At the time of the incident, the suspect was under the influence of amphetamines/methamphetamines. The suspect had an extensive criminal history including arrests for a violent crime, assault on a law enforcement officer, a weapons violation, and a drug law violation.",808
"During an ambush shooting incident on January 9, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Ceres Police Department was shot and killed, and a field training officer was critically injured. The suspect, a self- admitted gang member, called the Ceres Police Department Dispatch Center representing himself as an employee of a local market. He reported that he was being harassed by juveniles and requested that one officer be sent to his location. Fifteen minutes later, around 8:00 p.m. the suspect asked the owner of the market to call the police. He told the store owner that someone had shot at him, and the owner reported this to dispatch. Moments later, the owner of a store across the street called dispatch and reported a suspicious male who appeared to be holding a rifle. The 49-year-old field training officer, with 22 years of law enforcement experience, and his trainee arrived on the northwest side of the building at 8:11 p.m. in a “darked out” patrol unit and, according to a video tape recording, took a position of cover and concealment. The officer put out a “shots fired” call. The suspect was apparently waiting for the officers to arrive, and when he saw them at the corner of the building, he immediately fired at them with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. The field training officer was struck numerous times below his protective vest by the gunfire. Another officer arrived at the scene and helped provide suppression fire as the trainee helped the field training officer to cover, both of them firing as well. On the east side of the store, the 39-year-old sergeant with over 18 years of law enforcement experience arrived and exited his vehicle attempting to take cover behind a retaining wall. The suspect and the veteran sergeant exchanged gunfire. The suspect then ran toward the sergeant while firing his semiautomatic rifle. The rounds penetrated the sergeant’s protective vest, striking him several times in the chest. While the sergeant was down, the suspect fatally shot him two times at close range in the back of the head. The 19-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record and was under the influence of narcotics, fled the area on foot. Officers from several local law enforcement agencies responded to the area and set up a perimeter. Less than an hour later, the suspect was seen jumping a fence into an alley. He fired at officers on the perimeter. Four officers returned fire, killing him.",727
"A 46-year-old sergeant with the Midland County Sheriff’s Department was shot and killed around 2 p.m. on October 9 while participating in a tactical situation in Midland. The veteran sergeant, with 13½ years of law enforcement experience, was part of the U.S. Marshals’ Lone Star Fugitive Task Force. The sergeant and other task force members planned to serve a felony arrest warrant on an individual who was wanted for Continuous Sexual Assault of a Child. At approximately 1 p.m., the officers arrived at the individual’s residence, identified themselves as law enforcement, and ordered him to open the front door. He refused to comply, so one of the officers broke a window next to the door. Officers yelled to the individual through the broken window and advised him that they had a felony warrant for his arrest. While remaining concealed, the individual spoke with the sergeant through the broken window. The sergeant was on the porch, adjacent to the front door as he communicated with the individual. During the conversation, the individual fired a single shot from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and struck the sergeant, who was wearing body armor, in the front of the head. The sergeant immediately fell to the ground as the other officers on scene returned fire. The victim sergeant was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. At the scene, a standoff between the suspect and the remaining officers ensued. After several hours of negotiations, the individual exited the residence and surrendered without further incident. While in the patrol unit waiting to be transported to jail, the 37- year-old offender apologized to one of the officers for “hurting one of your own.” The offender was on probation at the time of the incident and had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, drug violations, and weapons violations. He was charged with Sexual Assault of a Child–Continuous and Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.

"On December 29 around 9 p.m., a 41-year-old police officer with the Chicago Police Department was killed during an armed robbery. The officer, who had over 9 years of law enforcement experience, was off duty but was working part-time as a security guard at a convenience store. Two men, both of whom wore dark face masks and displayed weapons, entered the establishment. The first suspect was armed with what appeared to be a semiautomatic firearm suspended by a strap over his shoulder. He walked straight at the officer, who was standing behind a service counter. The veteran officer announced his office as he attempted to draw his weapon and sought cover. However, the first suspect jumped up onto the counter and fired two rounds, one of which struck the officer in the stomach. The officer fired one round at the first suspect but missed. The wounded officer fell to the floor and as he was lying there, the second suspect reached over the counter and discharged three rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun into the victim officer’s back, fatally wounding him. The first suspect then reached under the victim’s body and removed the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon. The suspects stole cash from the registers and ran to the alley where the third suspect was waiting in a car. About 1 week later, the second gunman, a 29-year-old male on conditional release, and the accomplice who drove the car, a 34-year-old male on parole, were both arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer and Murder with Other Forcible Felony.

The two were among five officers who, when they arrived at the scene, learned that two men had been involved in a confrontation and one of them had shot and wounded the other. The shooter also fired at friends of the wounded man, then entered an apartment on the second floor. The officers evacuated residents from the surrounding apartments and attempted to contact the suspect. When the suspect failed to respond, the officers tried to knock down the hollow core door by kicking it in. On their first attempt, the officers broke the door at the bottom, but it did not open. An officer kicked the door again, and this time the door flew open. The suspect, armed with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, immediately opened fire on the officers. The officer who had kicked the door open, a 30-year-old with nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, was standing with his right side facing the open door and was struck in the chest by a bullet that entered through the armhole of his protective vest. He died instantly. A 27-year-old officer with 5½ years of law enforcement experience fired two shots at the suspect before he was hit by gunfire, once in the left hand and fatally in the front of his head. In an exchange of gunfire, a third officer was struck by a round from another officer that ricocheted from the exterior apartment wall. The same officer was also wounded by a shot that entered under the front panel of his protective vest when the suspect opened fire as officers attempted to retrieve the bodies of the two victim officers. After the area was secured, a SWAT team entered the apartment to find the 29-year-old suspect, who had prior mental disorders, dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The officer wounded by the suspect returned to duty about 4 weeks later.",1043
"A 33-year-old Baytown Police Department officer, a veteran with nearly 10 years of experience in law enforcement, was injured while responding to a robbery in progress shortly before 7:30 a.m. on April 11. As an employee at a check-cashing business was preparing to open the front door, a man approached, pointed a firearm at her, and ordered her to let him inside. As she opened the door, the employee pushed a portable panic button she was carrying. Once inside the business, the offender forced her to open interior doors, providing the employee an opportunity to enter a distress code into the alarm system. He restrained her with zip ties and told her to open the safe. When she hesitated, the offender sprayed her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. A second offender arrived at the door, and when the first offender had her open the door for him, she grabbed the keys to her vehicle, rushed outside, and tried to enter her vehicle as the two men attacked her. The officer arrived on the scene, and the employee broke free from her attackers and ran toward the officer, who was exiting his patrol unit. The two offenders began firing their weapons, one of which was a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, with many of the 15 rounds striking the officer’s vehicle and shattering the window and windshield. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was injured on the front and side of his head by shards of glass. The officer and the employee moved to the rear of the patrol unit, and the officer returned fire. A round struck one of the offenders in the leg, and he fell to the ground. The other offender tried to pull the wounded offender away, but was unable to do so and fled the scene on foot. Other officers arrived and took the 47-year-old wounded offender into custody.

"On June 15, two deputy sheriffs with the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office sustained fatal injuries while transporting prisoners in Kansas City. At 11:16 a.m., the deputies exited their transport vehicle to access a fenced transport dock containing inmates. While handcuffed in front of his body and with his legs shackled, one of the inmates grabbed the 35-year-old deputy’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The deputy, a veteran with 6 years of law enforcement experience, contacted radio dispatch. The 44-year-old deputy, a veteran with 9 years of law enforcement experience, drew her service weapon. Using the deputy’s firearm, the inmate fired one round at the 35-year-old deputy, fatally striking him in the front of his head.

The deputy, who had 21½ years of law enforcement experience, transferred a prisoner in a marked transport van from a mental facility to a secure area in the basement of the county courthouse for a hearing at 1 p.m. At the hearing, the judge ordered that the prisoner be returned to the mental facility. Because he was a mental health patient, the prisoner was not restrained during the transport or the hearing. Shortly after the hearing, the veteran deputy evidently permitted the prisoner to exit the vehicle, and the prisoner overpowered her. He apparently took the deputy’s .38-caliber service revolver and fired one fatal round into the side of her head. The 21-year-old alleged shooter then took the transport van and left the scene. Around 2:30 p.m., deputies at the courthouse discovered the victim deputy’s body in the basement where she was pronounced dead.

"As he worked a nighttime uniformed security assignment at a car dealership in Pompano Beach, a 25- year-old deputy with the Broward County Sheriff’s Office was killed at 12:40 a.m. on April 6 while attempting to thwart a larceny in progress at the establishment. Two individuals entered the car lot about 12:30 a.m. and broke into two sport utility vehicles by smashing the driver’s side windows. The noise apparently alerted the deputy, who was in the showroom.

When he came upon a wooden fence, the veteran officer climbed it, at which time he apparently encountered the subject, who shot him with the rifle. The fatal round exceeded the specifications of the victim officer’s body armor, striking him in his front upper torso/chest area. The assailant then fired a second shot into the back of the victim officer’s head. The 31-year-old assailant, who had a prior criminal record including police assault and weapons violations, turned the rifle on himself.

The victim officer’s service weapon was still in its holster. The three officers followed footprints to a nearby residence where they located the suspect standing in the front yard. The officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, and the second victim officer, who was also wearing body armor, was struck in the front below the waist and rear below the waist (in both legs). During the exchange of gunfire, the suspect was also struck and justifiably killed at the scene.

"At 3:15 p.m. on March 3, a 43-year-old detective with the Phoenix Police Department (Phoenix PD) was killed, and a 37-year-old Phoenix PD detective was injured while conducting investigative activity. Both detectives were veterans with more than 21 years and more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, respectively. The detectives, who were dressed in plain clothes, were searching for the subject of a felony warrant. The suspect was wanted for a probation violation and a probable cause charge for Aggravated Assault related to a shooting the prior week. The two detectives, and a third detective in a separate vehicle, were checking locations the suspect was known to frequent. At the suspect’s mother’s residence, the detectives observed a vehicle matching the description of a vehicle the suspect was known to use. The suspect was inside the vehicle and appeared to notice the presence of the detectives. He began driving in an evasive manner and exited the housing complex. Upon leaving the complex, the suspect accelerated rapidly and collided with another vehicle at an intersection about a mile away. The suspect left his vehicle and fled on foot, and witnesses reported seeing the suspect hide behind bushes nearby. The two detectives arrived, and just as the 43-year-old detective was exiting the passenger side of the vehicle, the suspect emerged from the bushes and fired numerous rounds from a .357-magnum revolver. The detective was fatally shot in his front upper torso/chest but managed to return fire, striking the suspect. The detective who was driving the vehicle removed his firearm from its holster but could not safely return fire. He was also hit and wounded in his front lower torso/stomach. The third detective, who was in a separate car, was approaching the area on foot when he heard gunshots and saw the suspect pointing his handgun at the other two detectives. He fired numerous rounds at the suspect, effectively incapacitating him. The detective then ran to provide medical aid to the other two detectives. Both detectives were transported to a hospital where emergency surgeries were performed, but the 43-year-old detective succumbed to his wounds later that evening. The 28-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, drug violations, and police assault, had been previously convicted. He was pronounced dead at the scene, justifiably killed by the third detective. The injured 37-year-old detective has since recovered and returned to duty.",690
