"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence.

The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects.

"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal.

On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area).

"Shortly after 5:30 p.m. on February 27, a 28-year-old police officer with the Prince William County Police Department (PWCPD) was mortally wounded, and two other PWCPD officers were injured while responding to a domestic disturbance call placed by a woman. A 31-year-old veteran officer, with more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence and asked the man about the whereabouts of his wife, who had placed the call. The man advised his wife was no longer there and then he attempted to close the door; however, the officer blocked the door with his foot and tried to force his way into the residence to investigate. Moments after the initial contact, a 33-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 10 years of law enforcement experience, and the 28-year-old officer, who was in training with 3 months of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene to assist. During the veteran officers’ attempt to force open the door, the suspect retrieved a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle and opened fire from the partially opened door. All three officers were wearing body armor, but their close proximity to the door gave them no response time. The 31-year-old victim officer was struck in the front below his waist, and the 28-year-old victim officer was struck in her rear upper torso/back by gunfire, which entered the armhole/shoulder area of her body armor, and in the rear below her waist. These two victim officers dragged themselves to vehicles parked nearby where they took cover and radioed for assistance. The third victim officer, the 33-year-old, was unable to move more than 10 feet from the door due to his injuries. He had been shot in his front upper torso/chest, the front below his waist, and his arms/hands. Responding officers provided field trauma treatment on all three victim officers before they were transported to a nearby trauma center via helicopter. The 28-year-old victim officer succumbed to the injury she received to her rear upper torso/back while in surgery. The two veteran officers survived their injuries. Meanwhile, the suspect surrendered after being challenged by additional responding officers and was taken into custody. During a subsequent security sweep of the residence, the suspect’s wife was located in an upstairs bedroom deceased after being shot multiple times with a handgun. Allegedly, the suspect knew his wife had contacted law enforcement during their verbal altercation, and he shot her with his handgun. He then staged his rifle at the front door and waited for police to arrive. The 32-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer, First-Degree Murder, two counts of Malicious Wounding of a Law Enforcement Officer, and two counts of Use of a Firearm in the Commission of a Felony. He had a prior criminal record which included a violent crime. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the two surviving officers had not returned to duty.",986
"A patrol officer with the Ferris Police Department was gunned down just be- fore 3 p.m. on October 6 after responding to a disturbance call regarding a person with a firearm at a local grocery store and gasoline station. The 28-year- old officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to the scene where a clerk re- ported a male who was wielding a shot- gun in the parking lot had shot a man. After securing the safety of several people at the scene, the officer saw the body of the victim on the ground between a gasoline pump and a pick-up truck.

"At 1:16 a.m. on November 30, a patrol officer with the Battle Creek Police Department was wounded while answering a call for service to check on the welfare of a citizen. The 33-year-old patrol officer and another officer were alerted to children shouting from a window of a residence. When the officers contacted the homeowner, she refused to allow officers to search the residence. The officers recognized a vehicle in the driveway that belonged to a 30-year-old violent offender wanted on a felony warrant. Known to be affiliated with a gang, the offender had a history of assaulting/threatening law enforcement officers. The officers positioned themselves nearby and observed the suspect leave the residence through a back door about 45 minutes later. The officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 11 years’ experience, caught the suspect after a foot pursuit through nearby backyards. As the officer prepared to handcuff the suspect, the homeowner—who was the suspect’s girlfriend—intervened and assaulted the officer, causing him to fall onto his back. This enabled the suspect, who was on his hands and knees, to retrieve a 9mm semiautomatic handgun from the waistband of his pants, rise, and discharge an unknown number of rounds at the officer while standing two feet away. Three rounds struck the officer: one round to the officer’s front upper torso/chest was stopped by the officer’s body armor, and the other rounds struck the officer in the front legs and the arms/hands. The officer drew his service weapon and fired 10 rounds at the offender while lying on his back. None of the rounds struck the offender. The offender fled and hid in another residence. Hours later, police found him hiding in a closet at that residence and arrested him.

Just after 3:20 in the afternoon, the sergeant called in via radio that he had stopped a vehicle for careless driving. He advised that a passenger had fled from the vehicle and entered an orange grove. He requested routine backup and checked on the availability of a K-9 unit. The victim sergeant, a law enforcement veteran with nearly 24 years of experience, then approached the vehicle and began a conversation with the lone remaining occupant of the vehicle.

"Around 3:30 a.m. on a cool autumn morning in the West, two uniformed officers, who each had 2 years of law enforcement experience, received a radio assignment to check on the welfare of a complainant's suicidal roommate. The officers arrived at the complainant's townhouse and saw him standing on a balcony. The complainant stated that his suicidal roommate was inside the unit. The officers asked the complainant to walk  downstairs and open the door, but he said he was scared. The officers asked the man for the door key, so he tossed his keys from the balcony to the officers below. The officers positioned themselves on each side of the door. As the officers put the key into the lock, the man fired several rounds from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the balcony. Rounds struck the wall, door, and both officers. One of the officers was hit with two rounds in his leg, one round to his groin, and a round in the back, which was stopped by his body armor.

Both officers recovered from their injuries and returned to full duty.  ",1239
"On March 4, at 6:18 p.m., a 33-year-old corporal with the Ouachita Parish Sheriff’s Office was shot after responding to a call to assist a deputy with an arrest. The veteran corporal, who had more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence in West Monroe where the suspect in an investigation of an Aggravated Battery with a Motor Vehicle had been located. The man was standing in the front yard of the residence, and after a brief interview by the officers, the man was advised that he was going to be taken into custody. As the officers attempted to arrest him, the man began backing away from them and said, “Uh-uh.” The corporal drew his Taser; and the suspect reached into the back waistband of his pants, produced a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, and started firing at the officers. The victim corporal was struck once in the back of his right shoulder, just outside his protective ballistic vest, as he was moving for cover.

"A 33-year-old deputy sheriff with the Taylor County Sheriff’s Department (TCSD) survived a shooting that occurred at 5:30 p.m. while he was conducting an investigative activity on September 8. The deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 9 years of experience, arrived at the residence of a woman in Westboro to investigate a restraining order violation. In spite of an active restraining order against her former boyfriend, the woman reported she had received multiple calls and text messages from him. After confirming the calls and messages were from the former boyfriend, the deputy drove to the subject’s address and parked his patrol vehicle on the street about 50 feet from the back of the residence. The deputy contacted the subject through the closed and locked front door and informed the subject of the complaint against him. The subject acknowledged the violation and asked if he was going to be arrested. The deputy affirmed that he was and requested several times that the man exit the residence. Each time the subject refused to come out. The conversation continued for approximately 10 minutes, and the subject became more agitated as time passed. The subject told the deputy that the deputy would need to obtain a warrant in order to take him into custody. He then stated he was going to commit suicide and retreated into the back portion of the residence. The deputy attempted to use his portable radio to request assistance, but was unable to make contact with dispatch. The deputy was still standing at the front door when he saw movement inside. The suspect fired one round from a .22-caliber lever-action rifle through the glass in the front door. The round grazed the left side of the deputy’s face, injuring the side of his head. The deputy ran to a nearby outbuilding and residence and took cover. Again, the deputy tried to contact dispatchers but was unsuccessful. Around that time, dispatch requested backup to respond to the location because they could not make contact with the deputy. The deputy could hear the radio traffic and was aware that additional officers were en route to the location, but he was unable to transmit the circumstances. All attempts to contact dispatchers were unsuccessful, so the deputy ran to his patrol vehicle and attempted to get inside. The suspect fired four or five more rounds at the deputy from an open window of his residence. Several of the rounds shattered the windows of the patrol vehicle and one round struck the deputy below his body armor in the front lower torso/stomach. The deputy drove his patrol vehicle approximately a half mile away, where he was able to radio dispatch and warn responding officers about the situation. When medical personnel arrived, the deputy was treated for his injuries and eventually air lifted by helicopter to a nearby hospital. During this time, the suspect fled his residence on foot, retrieved a firearm that he had hidden inside the wall of a dilapidated neighboring residence, and returned to his primary residence. Officers with the TCSD and several other area agencies responded to the scene. At approximately 8:30 p.m., a TCSD detective made telephone contact with the suspect and attempted to negotiate his surrender. The suspect ended the telephone contact several times within the next half an hour and reported he was going to shoot himself. Shortly after 9 p.m., the 27-year-old suspect complied with negotiators, exited his residence unarmed, and was taken into custody. The suspect, who was on probation, had a prior criminal record and convictions including violent crime and drug violations. He was a known drug user and under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident.

The 52-year-old officer, a nearly 8-year veteran of law enforcement, exited his vehicle and walked toward the residence as the 47-year-old officer, a veteran with over 22 years of law enforcement experience, arrived as backup. The 52-year-old officer was shot at from a second floor window with a .30-06 bolt-action rifle and was struck in the front below the waist and fatally in the front lower torso/stomach when the round entered below his body armor. The victim officer was able to fire 15 rounds at the suspect. While still in the patrol vehicle, the assisting officer, who was also wearing body armor, was wounded when one round entered between the side panels of his protective vest and struck him in the rear lower torso/back. A responding CPD sergeant arrived and saw the 52-year-old patrol officer on the ground. He drove his vehicle through the line of fire near the fallen officer and moved the officer partially into the vehicle. A Peters Township Police Department (PTPD) sergeant and a Cecil Township Police Department sergeant arrived to assist the CPD sergeant in getting the 52-year-old victim officer into a patrol vehicle and driving him to a hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries.

"Around 5:25 p.m. on December 12, a captain with the Woodburn Police Department (WPD) and a senior trooper with the Oregon State Police (OSP), Salem, were killed in a bomb blast while investigating an attempted bank extortion in Woodburn. The chief of the WPD was also injured in the blast. Earlier that day, the 51-year-old captain and the 46-year-old chief, both from WPD, as well as agents from the OSP, responded to the first of two banks involved. There, a hoax bomb device and a throw away cell phone were located in the bank’s dumpster and seized as evidence. Because an anonymous male caller referenced a second bank during the extortion attempt, investigators reported to the second bank after searching the first one. A metal box located in the bushes around the second bank was deemed by bank personnel to belong to the gardener, and since investigating officers found nothing else, the scene was cleared around noon. However, when the gardener arrived at the bank at 4 p.m., he advised that the metal box did not belong to him. Police were again summoned to the bank along with bomb squad personnel, one of whom was a 51-year-old senior trooper/bomb technician of the OSP with over 11 years’ law enforcement experience. The bomb technician x-rayed the box and determined that it was a hoax device. During the investigation, the WPD captain and chief who had been on the scene earlier in the day also arrived. Around 5:25 p.m., the OSP bomb technician took the metal box inside the bank due to a severe rainstorm. When the bomb technician attempted to manually open the box, it exploded, killing him and the WPD captain, who had more than 28 years of law enforcement experience. The men died of fatal wounds to multiple locations of their bodies. The WPD chief, who had more than 20 years of law enforcement experience, also sustained serious life-threatening injuries.

Around 2 a.m., a father and son, who had been consuming alcohol, left a campground in Townsend after telling family members they were going on a suicide mission. The deputy, a law enforcement veteran with 17 years of experience, was returning home after his shift when the duo’s vehicle passed him on the highway traveling at a high rate of speed. The deputy followed the vehicle for a short time then turned on his patrol unit’s lights and siren. When the pair failed to stop, the deputy informed dispatch of his pursuit, which reached 100 mph. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, had been following the vehicle for approximately 6 minutes when he was suddenly struck by gunfire. The deputy pulled his patrol unit to the side of the road and lost consciousness. The suspects turned their vehicle around and returned to the scene approximately 3 minutes later.

"At 12:30 p.m. on February 24, a 37-year-old police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) was assaulted with a knife while handling a person with a mental illness. Earlier that morning, a subject with a diagnosed mental illness and a history of threatening to cut herself with a knife locked herself inside her apartment. A social worker and the subject’s therapist arrived at the subject’s apartment at 9:30 a.m. and requested that she open her door so they could see that she was all right. The social worker and the therapist tried unsuccessfully to get the subject to open her door until around 11 a.m. At that time, they contacted the LAPD for assistance. Initially, two officers arrived and attempted to convince the subject to open her door. When they were unsuccessful, they called for assistance, and a sergeant and six more officers arrived. The officers tried repeatedly for nearly an hour to get the subject to open her door. The sergeant finally gave the order for the officers to breach the subject’s door shortly before noon. The officers disabled the deadbolt and the door knob. The veteran officer, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, attempted to push the door open, but the subject stood on the other side of the door and pushed back against him. Another officer attempted to pry the door open with a crowbar, while the veteran officer continued to push on the door. The subject had a large knife in each hand and slashed the veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, on the right forearm as he pushed the door open. Instead of entering the apartment, the officers allowed the door to close, and they stepped back. They radioed for the SWAT team to assist and, while waiting for the SWAT team to arrive, made further requests to the suspect to exit her apartment. The SWAT team arrived and repeatedly directed the suspect to exit her apartment and submit to arrest. The suspect refused, and the ensuing standoff lasted nearly 6 hours. During that time, officers evacuated the suspect’s neighbors from their apartments and obtained the necessary warrants to arrest the suspect and search her residence. The officers contacted the suspect’s son who eventually persuaded her to exit her residence at 5:20 p.m. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital where he was treated for the wound on his arm and released.

The 42-year-old veteran corporal, who had nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, was patrolling an interstate in a marked cruiser with the 26-year-old trooper, who had approximately 1½ years’ law enforcement experience. Following a report of a person driving a pickup truck in an erratic manner, the officers spotted the vehicle stopped in a “park and ride” lot just off the interstate. (It was later revealed that the vehicle had been reported stolen earlier in the day, but it had not yet been entered into the National Crime Information Center at the time of the incident.) The driver, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time, was taken into custody. With hands cuffed in front of him, the suspect was placed in the back seat of the cruiser while the corporal and trooper searched his vehicle. When they got back in the cruiser (which was not equipped with a prisoner barrier), the suspect produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun he had hidden in his groin area. He shot the victim corporal twice in the rear of the head and the victim trooper in the neck/throat above his body armor. The suspect then unlocked his handcuffs, removed the victim corporal’s .45-caliber handgun, and exited the cruiser. About this time, a tow truck the victims had requested arrived. The suspect shot the tow truck driver in the arm with the victim corporal’s .45-caliber service weapon and fled the scene. The tow truck driver called for assistance and law enforcement officers from the Roane County and Clay County Sheriff’s Departments as well as the Spencer Police Department responded. The tow truck driver, who was later treated for his wound and released, indicated the direction the suspect had fled and the officers began to search for him. As several deputies approached a ditch line, the suspect fired on them from a concealed position. A 43-year-old Roane County deputy, with nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, was struck in both arms. The victim deputy was also struck in the front upper torso/chest and rear upper torso/back, but his body armor prevented the rounds from penetrating his torso. The officers returned gunfire at the 22-year-old suspect and justifiably killed him. The suspect had a prior criminal record, which included violent crime, drug violations, and police assault. The victim corporal was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident; the victim trooper and the victim deputy were taken to a medical center by helicopter. The victim deputy underwent surgery for the wounds to his arms and survived his injuries. However, the victim trooper died three days later from the wound to his neck/throat.",835
"On April 26 at 6:30 p.m., a 30-year-old deputy sheriff with the Pittsylvania County Sheriff’s Office sustained a gunshot wound while responding to a domestic call in Chatham. The deputy, who had more than two years of law enforcement experience, and another deputy responded to a call from a man who stated his son shot his cell phone. The man explained he was currently located outside his residence, and his armed son was inside the home. While en route to the scene, dispatch alerted the deputies the son had fired a second round from the door of the residence. The deputies arrived and saw the father of the suspect standing outside near a truck. They exited their patrol units and approached the father. As the deputies drew closer, the son stepped out of the house with a 12-gauge shotgun and fired a round toward the ground near the tire of a second vehicle parked in the driveway. The deputies and the father took cover behind the truck. The deputies ordered the suspect to drop his weapon and instructed the father to move to a safer location away from the residence. The suspect opened the main front door, but left the storm door closed. While the deputies were focused on the front door, the suspect fired a round toward them from the home’s front window. A round from the shotgun struck the victim deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The deputies reported the situation to dispatch and requested backup. Multiple officers responded to the scene and, using a police vehicle as a rolling barricade, removed the deputies from their position of cover behind the truck. The injured deputy was transported to a local hospital where doctors removed the round from his head. Meanwhile, officers established a perimeter around the suspect’s residence, evacuated nearby homes, and requested assistance from the SWAT team. After several hours of negotiations and the use of tear gas, the suspect exited the residence and surrendered to SWAT team members at 12:30 a.m. on April 27. The 37-year-old suspect was taken into custody and charged with Attempted Murder and Causing Bodily Injury to a Law Enforcement Officer/Fire/Rescue Person. He had a prior criminal record including charges for a police assault and drug law violation. The wounded deputy recovered from his injury and has since returned to duty.",1171
"A 46-year-old patrol officer with the East Washington Police Department was killed and a second 46- year-old patrol officer was injured during a traffic stop on December 18. The first patrol officer, a 5½- year veteran of law enforcement, stopped a vehicle for an apparent traffic violation. During the stop, it was discovered that the driver had an expired registration and no insurance for the vehicle. The second officer, a 21-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived to assist. After both officers decided to impound the vehicle, they approached the vehicle and asked the driver to exit. The driver emerged from the vehicle with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and immediately shot the first officer, who was wearing body armor, in the front below the waist. The driver then fired at the second officer, striking him in the right hand. When the second officer fell to the ground, the driver turned back to the first officer who lay wounded on the ground and shot him in the side of the head, killing him. The second officer exchanged gunfire with the shooter with his left hand, then retreated to a safe area and called for assistance. The suspect fled to his residence nearby. Within an hour, law enforcement officers had set up a perimeter around the house. After several hours, a police tactical team deployed tear gas into the home. The 58-year-old suspect fired a round from the window before officers saw him exit the rear door of the house armed with a shotgun. A tactical team sniper justifiably shot and killed him. ",430
"On April 18 at 9:20 a.m., a 40-year-old deputy sheriff with the Logan County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed while responding to a call for service regarding an eviction in Mulhall. When the deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence, he encountered a married couple and another man who were loading a rental truck. The deputy asked for their identification, ran checks on them through dispatch, and was informed that one of the individuals may have an outstanding warrant. Meanwhile, the couple went back inside to continue packing the truck, while the other man sat on the porch. The landlord of the residence arrived and parked behind the deputy’s patrol vehicle. The deputy went to speak with the landlord at his vehicle, and afterward the landlord backed his car out of the driveway. As the deputy began walking toward the man on the porch, the man stood up, walked to within 10 feet of the deputy, brandished a semiautomatic handgun, and fired seven rounds. The deputy sustained injuries in areas that were not protected by his body armor: his front head, neck/throat, front upper torso/chest, rear upper torso/back, and arms/hands. The suspect stole the deputy’s patrol vehicle and fled the scene. The deputy was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to the injury to the front of his head. The 45-year-old suspect was arrested later that day, but the handgun was not recovered. He was charged with First-Degree Murder, Larceny of a Motor Vehicle, and Robbery.

The officer was awoken in his home by the sound of breaking glass at his neighbor’s house. He gathered his police shield, cell phone, and off-duty weapon, and went outside to investigate. He called for backup after seeing a broken basement window. As two individuals emerged from the house, the officer identified himself as a police officer and gave a verbal command to stop. One of the suspects, aged 48, fired a .357-caliber revolver, striking the police officer in the chest.

"In the following days, video footage from a gas station near Tabor City showed the suspect had been a passenger in the truck, and a second man was actually the driver. The truck had left the gas station approximately 16 minutes before the trooper was killed at the traffic stop, which happened to be the driving time between the two locations. Further investigation indicated the driver was the actual shooter. Agents with the SBI Criminal Apprehension Team accessed the new suspect’s social media accounts and telephone numbers and located him in Loris, South Carolina. On October 23, SBI agents coordinated with South Carolina authorities and took the new suspect, who was on probation, into custody without incident. The 18-year-old suspect was charged with First-Degree Murder and Possession of a Firearm by a Felon. His criminal history included incarceration for a violent crime.

"A 23-year-old trooper with the Montana Highway Patrol, Bozeman, was shot and killed on December 1 around 4:20 in the afternoon while investigating a suspicious person or circumstance in Three Forks. The trooper, who had a little more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, was patrolling the area when he saw a man with a shotgun in a field. The trooper believed the locale to be an area where hunting was not allowed, and he radioed the Three Forks Marshal’s Office and requested marshal assistance in contacting the individual. However, before assistance could arrive, the man got into his vehicle and started to leave the vicinity, and the trooper attempted to stop him. Apparently, the man exited his automobile and after a brief encounter with the trooper, he returned to his vehicle, retrieved a 12-gauge shotgun, and shot the trooper in the abdomen. The trooper, who was wearing body armor, managed to shoot his attacker once. The assailant reloaded his shotgun and fired at the victim trooper again, striking him in the front upper torso/chest, in the front of the head, and fatally in the throat.

"Just before 5 p.m. on January 30, a 42-year-old deputy sheriff with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office was killed in an ambush in Marianna. He was responding to a call for help at the home of the Jackson County sheriff. Moments earlier, the wife of the sheriff had called her husband on her mobile phone and told him that a car had followed her from the highway into their driveway. The sheriff told her he was on his way home, but before he arrived, she called him again screaming into the phone. He immediately advised dispatch of the situation and requested help. The responding deputy, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, was within 2 minutes of the home and was the first to arrive. Dispatch then heard what sounded like someone saying “help.” The sheriff, a captain, and a corporal arrived at the scene at the same time. One of the men who had followed the sheriff’s wife home was waiting behind a bush, along with his accomplice. The suspect stepped out, shooting at the sheriff. The captain and corporal fired upon the suspects, justifiably killing them both. The officers then went to the back of the home, where they found the victim deputy and the sheriff’s wife both deceased from gunshot wounds. The victim deputy had been shot in the front of the head, in the arms/hands, and fatally in the front upper torso/chest with a .38-caliber revolver.

"A 31-year-old investigator with the Cleveland Heights Police Department was shot and killed when he responded to a disturbance call around 9:45 p.m. on May 25. The investigator, a 7-year veteran of law enforcement, was in the lead of two police vehicles that responded from the west as another officer approached from the east to the location of a large fight. All of the officers noticed a westbound vehicle when the driver turned around, headed in the opposite direction, then backed into a driveway. To block the suspicious vehicle, the investigator drove alongside the driveway with the driver’s side of his vehicle closest to the curb and parked with his emergency lights and side spotlight activated. The investigator had maneuvered his vehicle so that his driver’s side door was aligned with the outside of the suspect’s driver’s door.

"A 29-year-old detective corporal was killed and a 37-year-old patrol officer was injured when the pair, both from the Polk County Police Department, answered a call for service at 10:46 a.m. on September 29. The officer, who had less than 1 year of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a driveway in Cedartown. No passengers were in the parked vehicle, and a check of its registration showed the car had been reported stolen. The officer found a wallet in the vehicle with a woman’s identification card, Social Security card, and a credit or debit card. He did not yet have experience processing the paperwork associated with recovering a stolen vehicle, so he radioed for assistance. The detective, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 9 years of experience, radioed she was en route to help. The officer began work on his report as he sat in his marked patrol unit waiting on the detective and a tow truck to arrive. He soon heard footsteps in the leaves behind the vehicle. He leaned forward to get a better view of the area behind him when he saw a male and a female approaching the vehicle from the rear passenger side. The officer exited the patrol unit and asked the couple why they were in the area. The male pointed to the stolen vehicle and said they were there to retrieve the female’s wallet. The officer asked the female her name, and it matched the name on the items from the wallet. The detective arrived on the scene as the officer was instructing the pair to put their belongings on the ground. The male and female were leaning over very slowly and acting suspiciously as they placed their belongings on the ground when the male produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired two rounds at the officer from approximately 18 feet away. Both rounds struck the officer in his front upper torso/chest but were stopped by his body armor—one of the rounds hit his radio before striking the vest, rendering his radio useless. The officer fell to his knees and fired five rounds from his service weapon. None of the rounds struck the male, who had taken cover in front of the officer’s patrol unit. The male then moved to the passenger side of the car and fired four rounds at the detective. All four rounds struck the detective fatally in her front upper torso/chest, and she fell to the ground. The male then fired two additional rounds at the officer. After realizing his shoulder radio had been destroyed by a bullet, the wounded officer crawled to his patrol unit, quickly assessed the detective’s condition, and used the patrol unit’s radio to call for help. The two subjects appeared to have fled, so the wounded officer rapidly retrieved his shotgun from the trunk of the patrol unit and attempted to give the victim detective CPR until other personnel arrived, all while keeping watch for the subjects in case they returned. The victim detective succumbed to her injuries, and the injured officer was transported to a local hospital. The 31-year-old male offender was arrested later that day and charged with Malice Murder, Felony Murder, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, Theft by Receiving Stolen Property, Aggravated Assault Against a Police Officer During Official Duties, and Willful Obstruction of a Law Enforcement Officer by Use of Threats or Violence.

"On August 10, around 7:40 a.m., a corporal with the Sebastian County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) was shot and killed in an ambush (entrapment and premeditation). The 66-year-old corporal, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 20 years’ experience, was part of a team of six officers that had been dispatched with regard to a 911 call from a man who reported his son had stolen some tools and pulled a gun on him. At 7:08 a.m., the officers arrived at a rural residence to find the suspect on the porch with a rifle, which he pointed at the officers before retreating into the residence. The officers noted the suspect was wearing some type of ballistic vest, and they began to take perimeter positions at the residence. (It was subsequently revealed the suspect was agitated because he was due in court later that day on a Petition to Revoke a Suspended Sentence.) At 7:16 a.m., officers reported to dispatch the suspect was firing on them from within the residence. Additional officers, representing various agencies, arrived to assist. At 7:39 a.m., the suspect shot the corporal in the neck/throat above his body armor as he was seeking cover behind the rear corner of a mobile home located approximately 125 feet from the suspect’s residence. (The round traveled through the mobile home and struck the buttstock of the deputy’s rifle before striking him.) Five more officers reported to the scene to help extract the wounded corporal. The additional officers also came under fire from the suspect, and the chief of police of the Hackett Police Department (HPD), a veteran of law enforcement with 13 years of experience, was hit as he was exiting his cruiser more than 300 feet away from the suspect. The 42-year-old chief, who was wearing body armor, sustained a gunshot wound to the head. While still under fire, members of the arriving group extracted the wounded chief from the scene. At nearly the same time, members of the SCSO SWAT team were able to locate the wounded corporal at a rear corner of the residence and take him to the emergency medical area. Both wounded officers were taken to a nearby hospital where the chief was treated and released for his head wound, and the corporal was taken to surgery.

"At 11:24 a.m. on November 28, a 34-year-old police officer with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department was injured in an unprovoked attack while working as a special operations detective. The plainclothes officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 10 years’ experience, was driving an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows and was accompanied by another officer. They came upon a vehicle that was driving erratically—swerving in and out of lanes and running red lights—so they began following it. The officers got close enough to the vehicle to notice it had a temporary license plate number. They radioed in to check the license status and the response indicated the temporary tag was stolen. The officers requested a follow-up to see if the vehicle’s make and model was also listed as stolen. While waiting for the response, the officers followed the vehicle until they stopped at a traffic light in the right lane; the vehicle with the stolen tag was stopped slightly behind them in the left lane. As a response came over the radio, the veteran officer noticed that the vehicle’s passenger had exited the car and was standing four feet away from the driver’s side of the officers’ vehicle. The man was armed with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle and ordered the officers to exit their vehicle. Fearing the man would realize they were law enforcement officers and open fire, the veteran officer, who was in the driver’s seat, drew his service weapon and fired several rounds through his driver’s-side window toward the armed assailant. As the assailant retreated toward the vehicle with the stolen tag, the veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, exited his vehicle to seek cover behind the passenger side of his patrol vehicle. At some point, the assailant fired two rounds, and the veteran officer was struck by shrapnel in the forehead. The victim officer reloaded and fired several more rounds across the hood of his vehicle. Meanwhile, the driver of the suspect’s vehicle made a U-turn and fled the scene, leaving the assailant, who had gunshot wounds to his legs and arms, lying in the street. The officers’ supervisor arrived at the scene, and the officers took the assailant into custody.

"A 36-year-old patrol officer with the Richmond Police Department was shot in the arms/hands while responding to a disturbance call shortly before 5:30 p.m. on August 5. The officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 8 ½ years of experience, was dispatched with other officers to a report of an individual flashing a firearm. The officers turned into a nearby alley where they saw a person matching the description of the individual with the firearm. Upon exiting the vehicle, one of the officers asked the individual his name, and he replied. The officer also saw a handgun in the right side of the individual’s waistband. When the officer asked the individual to come over, the individual asked if he was under arrest. The officer said no, and the individual began running down the alley. Officers pursued; the first officer, who had spoken to the individual, veered around a parked car. The second officer stayed behind the individual, who fell on some gravel. The officer, not anticipating the individual’s fall, ran past him a slight distance before stopping. The officer, who was wearing body armor, turned to face the individual and reached for his conductive energy device. At the same time, the individual rose, produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and fired a single shot at the officer at close range, striking him in the arms/hands (left arm). The victim officer, who was known to the suspect through a prior law enforcement relationship, fell to the ground, and the suspect began to run down the alley in the direction they had just come from. As the suspect ran, he continued to fire at the officers. The victim officer, despite his wound, was able to get on his knees and fire a shot at the suspect with his service weapon, but missed. The victim officer then held his fire to avoid hitting the pursuing officer. The pursuing officer continued to chase the suspect, who had turned as he ran away and shot at both officers. The pursuing officer fired back at the suspect with his handgun until the suspect made a turn around a wooden fence and shed. When the officer regained sight of the suspect, he was on the ground near a fence; the suspect did not respond to the officer’s commands. When other officers arrived, they placed the suspect in handcuffs and called for an ambulance. The 20-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to use and deal drugs, had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime and a weapons violation. He was justifiably killed by the pursuing officer during their exchange of gunfire. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital in a police vehicle. He has since returned to duty.",1089

As they exited for the evening and made their way to their vehicles, they saw a man pacing in the parking lot and arguing with someone via cell phone. The man noticed the group looking at him, and he yelled and cursed at them for staring. He abruptly ended his phone call and accosted the group. The confrontation escalated, and the man produced a knife. The agent showed his badge and tried to calm the suspect down. The suspect slapped the badge out of the agent’s hand and thrust the knife at him, slashing the agent’s leg and his chin. The agent’s friends came to his aid while the offender turned and ran.

Shortly after 7 p.m., a woman arrived at the county sheriff’s office to report that her intoxicated husband had struck her during an argument about 30 minutes prior in Batesville. An officer from the Batesville PD came to assist and asked the woman if she would like to go to a women’s shelter for her safety; the woman answered yes. On the way to the shelter, the woman decided to file charges against her husband. The officer contacted Batesville’s police chief to discuss the situation and then contacted the 31-year-old patrol officer and asked him to go to the couple’s residence to arrest the husband for domestic battery. The police chief planned to meet the patrol officer there. Just before 8 p.m., the patrol officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence. The subject met the officer at the doorway, and the officer instructed the subject to come outside. When the subject refused, the officer advised the subject he was under arrest. The subject turned his back to the officer, picked up a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, turned around, and fired at the officer. As the officer saw the suspect retrieving the firearm, he turned and retreated down the porch stairs to seek cover. The subject shot the officer, who was wearing body armor, four times in the front and rear of his legs and feet. The victim officer advised dispatch that shots had been fired and requested assistance. Several units responded, including the police chief. Responding officers ordered the offender to exit the residence. Instead of exiting, the offender aimed a .223 semiautomatic rifle at one of the officers, who then fired two shots at the offender. One round struck and justifiably killed the 44-year-old offender. Investigators suspect the incident may have been a suicide-by-cop. The victim officer was hospitalized and treated for his wounds. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the victim officer had not returned to duty.",288
"A 40-year-old deputy sheriff with the Clark County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack at a trailer park in Springfield around 11:48 a.m. on January 1. The deputy, who was a 12-year veteran of law enforcement, and a CCSO sergeant responded to a report of shots fired. After they arrived on the scene, the sergeant interviewed nearby residents while the deputy, who was wearing body armor, began gathering evidence and photographing the scene where the shots were allegedly fired. A man exited one of the trailers, produced a 12-gauge shotgun, and shot the deputy in the head. The sergeant heard the gunfire and ran to the area. He located the victim deputy, but was unable to get to her. The sergeant notified communications of shots fired and that an officer was down. Another deputy responded to the scene, and additional officers from multiple jurisdictions were called to assist. Approximately 12:40 p.m., officers were preparing to remove the victim deputy from the scene when the suspect began shooting at them. In an exchange of gunfire, a 32-year-old patrol officer with the German Township Police Department was struck in the arms/hands. He was taken from the scene to a local hospital for treatment. A short time later, the Fairborn Police Special Response Team (SRT) arrived with an armored vehicle, and the SRTs from the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP) and the Springfield Police Division also responded. The SRTs removed the victim deputy from the scene, and she was transported to a local hospital where she later died. OSHP SRT members used tactical surveillance equipment to see that the suspect was lying face down in his trailer. An SRT medic entered the trailer to examine the suspect, but he could not find a pulse. The 57-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included police assault and weapons violations, had apparently died in the shootout with officers.",1094
"A 54-year-old patrol officer with the San Antonio Police Department died on June 21 as a result of injuries he sustained while responding to a disturbance call on February 17, 1977. At the time of the incident, the 24-year-old officer had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience when he responded to a report of a man with a gun at a lounge. As the officer opened the door to the establishment, an individual shot the officer an unknown number of times in the chest, stomach, and below the waist with a .22-caliber revolver.

"On April 21 at 2:48 p.m., a 35-year-old officer attached to the Santa Fe Springs office of the California Highway Patrol was shot down in an apparent ambush as he walked from the courthouse in Pomona to a nearby parking lot. The officer, with 5 years’ experience in law enforcement, had paused at the edge of the street to wait for a passing automobile. However, the vehicle stopped approximately 11–20 feet away, and before driving off, the lone occupant fired three to five shots from a .38-caliber revolver at the uniformed officer.

Investigators traced the vehicle’s license plate and identified the owner of the automobile, who lived in Fontana, California. The police located the owner who indicated that he had allowed his young son to use the automobile for the day. A search of the house turned up evidence that the son was a member of a violent gang that had sworn vengeance against the Pomona police following the justifiable killing of a juvenile gang member by a police officer a few months earlier. The 16-year-old male, who had a criminal history involving weapons violations, was located and arrested the following day. He was charged with Murder.",784
"A 29-year-old police officer with the Fort Myers Police Department (FMPD) was fatally wounded on July 21 while responding to a call for service. The incident began at 7:16 p.m. when a complainant called 911 to report a suspect who provoked an altercation with three young men filling their vehicle’s fuel tank at a gas station. Five officers answered the call for service. The 29-year-old officer spoke with the complainant, who explained that two of the men were “minding their own business,” when the suspect approached the man in the front passenger seat in an aggressive manner, yelling at him. One of the vehicle’s occupants was inside the convenience store. When he returned to the vehicle, he attempted to pull the suspect away from his companion. The suspect lunged into the vehicle, stole a cell phone from inside, and fled across the street. The three young men returned to their vehicle and left the parking lot in search of the suspect. After speaking with the complainant, all of the officers left the gas station to search the area for the suspect. At approximately 7:29 p.m., a lieutenant located the suspect and was joined by the 29-year-old officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor. The officer’s body camera recorded the suspect face down on the ground with a silver cell phone beside him. Both the lieutenant and the officer repeatedly told the suspect to stand up and speak with them, but he would not comply. At that point, one of the three men initially involved in the altercation at the gas station drove up with his brother, parked alongside the officers, got out, and spoke with the officers. The suspect got up and lunged toward the vehicle, prompting one of the two men to move toward the suspect in an attempt to keep him from entering the vehicle. The suspect turned and ran north. The officer pursued him. When the officer caught up with the suspect, the suspect slowed his pace, turned around, and struck the officer, knocking him to the ground. While the officer was on the ground, the suspect hovered over him, hitting him again before pulling the officer’s duty weapon from his holster, and firing six rounds from the .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. One round struck the officer, wounding the rear and side of his head. The lieutenant radioed for assistance and rushed to render aid to the fallen officer. Another responding officer located the suspect running back to the gas station with a firearm in his hand. The responding officer’s patrol vehicle had a dashboard camera, and he was also wearing a body camera. Once at the gas station, the suspect shattered the glass front door, entered the store using the side door, and attempted to climb over the counter and hide. The store owner told him to leave. The suspect cocked the firearm and told the store owner that he had been shot, then exited the building and aimed the firearm in the direction of another officer outside. The officer fired several rounds from his rifle, striking the suspect in the upper leg. The suspect fell to his stomach with the firearm still clenched in his hand. Additional officers arrived on scene and instructed the suspect to drop the weapon, show his hands, and place his hands behind his back. The suspect looked around at the officers for a moment before complying. Officers recovered the victim officer’s weapon from the ground near the suspect and took the suspect into custody.

The other responding officers left the location because the suspect was not at the residence. The veteran officer remained in the area in his patrol unit to search for the suspect. At 4:26 a.m., using his radio, the officer requested a description of the suspect. At 5:49 a.m., an unidentified caller contacted the police department and reported a patrol unit parked in the street with an unresponsive driver. Arriving officers found the victim officer slumped over in his vehicle with two gunshot wounds to the side of his head, one in the neck/throat area, and one in the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. The victim officer was pronounced dead at the scene from the wounds to the side of his head. Four spent .40-caliber handgun casings were found outside the driver’s side of the victim officer’s vehicle. Further investigation identified the man from the domestic incident as a suspect in the shooting of the officer. Later that day, the 25-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with Murder. He was on probation at the time of the incident and had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, police assault, and drug violations.",729
"On June 25, a sergeant with the Navajo Division of Public Safety, Tuba City, was killed while attempting to arrest a man during a domestic violence call. The 48-year-old sergeant was a veteran with more than 25 years of law enforcement experience. At 10:23 p.m., the sergeant and another officer responded in separate patrol vehicles to a domestic violence call at a residence in Kaibeto, a community within the Navajo Indian Reservation. They detained two brothers at the scene. The sergeant escorted one brother to his vehicle parked behind the residence, and the officer escorted the other brother to his vehicle parked in front of the residence. It was at this time the officer heard multiple gunshots coming from behind the house. The officer turned to find the sergeant returning gunfire at the direction of the residence. Upon arriving at the sergeant’s side, the officer saw a third man on his hands and knees with a pistol lying beneath him, several feet away from the sergeant. The man, the father of the two men who were being arrested, had fired a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at the sergeant four times. Two of the rounds were deflected by the sergeant’s body armor, and two rounds circumvented the vest, one of which struck the sergeant in his upper back. The sergeant was transported to the hospital where he died the next day. The 48-year-old suspect was hit twice by the return fire and was also transported to a hospital.

"A 40-year-old deputy sheriff with the Clark County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack at a trailer park in Springfield around 11:48 a.m. on January 1. The deputy, who was a 12-year veteran of law enforcement, and a CCSO sergeant responded to a report of shots fired. After they arrived on the scene, the sergeant interviewed nearby residents while the deputy, who was wearing body armor, began gathering evidence and photographing the scene where the shots were allegedly fired. A man exited one of the trailers, produced a 12-gauge shotgun, and shot the deputy in the head. The sergeant heard the gunfire and ran to the area. He located the victim deputy, but was unable to get to her. The sergeant notified communications of shots fired and that an officer was down. Another deputy responded to the scene, and additional officers from multiple jurisdictions were called to assist. Approximately 12:40 p.m., officers were preparing to remove the victim deputy from the scene when the suspect began shooting at them. In an exchange of gunfire, a 32-year-old patrol officer with the German Township Police Department was struck in the arms/hands. He was taken from the scene to a local hospital for treatment. A short time later, the Fairborn Police Special Response Team (SRT) arrived with an armored vehicle, and the SRTs from the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP) and the Springfield Police Division also responded. The SRTs removed the victim deputy from the scene, and she was transported to a local hospital where she later died. OSHP SRT members used tactical surveillance equipment to see that the suspect was lying face down in his trailer. An SRT medic entered the trailer to examine the suspect, but he could not find a pulse. The 57-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included police assault and weapons violations, had apparently died in the shootout with officers. ",375
"Two officers with the Georgetown Police Department were shot around 6:40 p.m. on September 1 while investigating a complaint of shots being fired at a local fast-food restaurant. A 29-year-old patrol officer, who had nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot in the incident, and a 31-year- old corporal, who had nearly 7 years of law enforcement experience, sustained minor injuries. The officers were on patrol together when they heard a broadcast providing a description of a vehicle occupied by the suspects involved in the reported shooting incident, which allegedly also involved a robbery. According to later reports, one or more of the suspects had robbed a drug dealer and then had fired rounds at the dealer before fleeing the scene with an undisclosed amount of marijuana. The patrol officer and the corporal, both of whom were wearing body armor, spotted the suspects’ vehicle in front of them. The corporal, who was driving the patrol car, began to pursue the vehicle, which was occupied by three men. The pursuit ended when the suspects’ vehicle came to an abrupt stop, and the corporal stopped alongside it. A passenger in the rear driver’s side of the suspects’ vehicle shot through his partially opened window with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The round entered the officers’ passenger side window and struck the patrol officer in the face, killing him. The corporal, unaware that his partner was struck, received a minor injury to his neck from shrapnel from the round. In spite of his injury, he exited the vehicle and began a foot pursuit of the driver, who had gotten out of the suspects’ vehicle and was fleeing the scene. The driver managed to escape, however, and when the corporal returned to the police vehicle, it was only then that he realized that his partner had been shot, and he called for assistance. One of the suspects had remained in the car at the original location and was apprehended; one of the other suspects, the alleged shooter who had killed the officer, had also fled the scene. He was tracked to an area east of the scene, and several assisting officers converged there.

"Approximately 6 o'clock on a warm spring evening in the South, multiple officers were serving a warrant at the residence of a suspect who was wanted for the attempted murder of law enforcement officers. The warrant stemmed from a shootout that had occurred during a vehicle pursuit the previous day and had involved several officers. When serving the warrant, officers approached the front door of the residence and announced their presence. The offender fired several rounds from an SKS semiautomatic rifle through the door and wall, striking two officers. A 13-hour standoff ensued when several officers surrounded the residence, and the offender barricaded himself inside.

The offender was convicted and sentenced to several years in prison.",1231
"Around 8:30 p.m. on August 1, two senior deputies with the Kern County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO) sustained gunshot wounds while responding to a tactical situation. Prior to the senior deputies’ encounter, a suspect allegedly held three individuals at gunpoint in a cabin and threatened to kill them. When the individuals escaped, the suspect stole an ATV/UTV and drove to a cabin in another area. There, he allegedly used a shotgun to murder a man, stole two handguns and an SUV vehicle, then fled the scene and traveled northeast before the vehicle he was driving became disabled. KCSO SWAT officers tracked the suspect to a property where he fired a revolver at deputies. The 40-year-old senior deputy, who had nearly 14 years of law enforcement experience, suffered wounds to his arms/hands. He was transported to a hospital for treatment.

"Approximately 2:30 a.m. on July 9, a New York Police Department police officer was shot and killed and his partner seriously wounded during a traffic stop. The 23-year-old officer, who had nearly a year and a half of law enforcement experience, was riding in a marked cruiser being driven by his 26-year-old partner. The two spotted a suspicious vehicle and made a Department of Motor Vehicles check that revealed that the license plate did not match the vehicle. The officers, both of whom were wearing body armor, pulled over the vehicle and exited their police car. They approached the vehicle, later discovered to be stolen, with the partner walking up to the driver’s side and the officer approaching the passenger’s side. The driver produced a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and shot across the car, striking the officer once in the front of the head. The victim officer immediately fell to the ground. Nearly simultaneously, a passenger in the back of the vehicle shot the victim officer’s partner twice with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking him in the chest and forearm. The partner’s body armor prevented the shot from penetrating his chest. The wounded officer returned fire, but the perpetrators were able to speed off. Though wounded, the fallen officer’s partner called in the emergency situation and gave a description of the vehicle. Both officers were then taken to a nearby hospital where the fallen officer died 5 days later. His partner, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, was treated for his wounds and eventually was released from the hospital.

The 36-year-old veteran officer had more than 7 years of police experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident. She was flagged down by a passing motorist who reported that a man was screaming at cars and blocking traffic several blocks away. At the same time, another Poughkeepsie PD officer was dispatched to the area for the same disturbance. He arrived first, and the man immediately confronted the officer while he was still in his vehicle. The officer pulled his patrol vehicle away from the man to create some distance. At that time, the officer who had been flagged down arrived and opened the door to exit her patrol vehicle, but the man ran at her before she could get out. He began slashing her with a box cutter, wounding her on the front of her head, her neck/throat, and on her arms/hands. The victim officer unsuccessfully attempted to fire her electronic control device. The other officer on the scene witnessed the situation and drew his duty weapon. The offender persisted, who was now on top of the victim officer in her patrol vehicle. The officer fired his weapon. The offender then pulled the victim officer out of her vehicle, and both fell to the ground where he continued his assault. The victim officer’s patrol vehicle was still in gear and rolled past her as she struggled with the offender on the ground. The other officer continued firing at the suspect until his service weapon was empty. The offender was wounded, and the victim officer, though injured, freed herself from under him. She got to her feet and managed to stop her rolling patrol vehicle. After securing it, the victim officer exited the vehicle and collapsed on the curb. Bystanders provided assistance.

"A patrol officer with the Auburn Police Department (APD) was severely injured at 6:25 p.m. on February 15. The 30-year-old officer was shot while investigating an armed robbery that had taken place earlier that day. At 5:30 p.m., the APD received a call reporting an armed robbery in progress at a business. The caller believed the suspect possessed a firearm and an explosive. When officers arrived at the business, the suspect had fled in a vehicle. Officers collected the description of the suspect and getaway vehicle and broadcast the information to all law enforcement personnel in the area. Less than an hour later, the APD officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 5 years’ experience, saw the suspect’s vehicle traveling on a roadway that was less than a mile from the location of the robbery.  When the suspect turned his vehicle into a nearby parking lot, the officer followed and activated his emergency lights to initiate a traffic stop. Before approaching the vehicle, the officer observed that the driver was female and determined that the male passenger fit the description of the suspect; therefore, the officer approached the passenger side. The officer’s body camera and in-car dash camera footage showed the suspect refused to obey the officer’s commands to keep his hands in sight. The officer saw the suspect draw a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The officer, who was wearing body armor, reached inside the vehicle through the window to control the armed offender, but the offender shot the officer in the side of his head. The officer fell back and attempted to seek cover. The offender exited the vehicle and continued firing at the injured officer. The offender fired 11 rounds at the officer, striking him six times. In addition to his head, the officer was shot in his rear upper torso/back, rear below his waist/buttocks, and his arms/hands. The officer took cover in a nearby ditch, and the offender returned to the vehicle and fled the scene. Witnesses called 911, and responding officers arrived about a minute after the offender fled. They rendered aid to the injured officer until emergency medical personnel transported him to a local hospital. Immediate investigation of the scene included reviewing video footage of the offender. Officers recognized him and knew his name. Around 9:45 p.m., APD officers gathered intelligence that the offender was at an apartment approximately 5 miles away from the scene of the shooting.

Shortly after, officers realized the room the offender was in was on fire, and they retreated and set up a perimeter around the building. The local fire department responded and extinguished the blaze. Law enforcement found two bodies inside the burned room, that of the offender and the female driver. The autopsy reports showed the female had been shot in the head and had died before the fire started. Her death was ruled a homicide. The 38-year-old offender died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was wanted on a felony warrant and had a criminal history that included a drug law violation and a weapons violation. The injured APD officer has since returned to duty.",67
"On January 22 at 8:50 a.m., a 28-year-old deputy sheriff and a 38-year-old sergeant with the Del Norte County Sheriff’s Office (DNCSO) were stabbed and injured while answering a disturbance call in Crescent City. A woman called dispatch and reported her roommate was in her room yelling at her. The deputy sheriff, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence and was met at the front door by the roommate, who let the deputy in. Once inside, the deputy turned on his body camera and then spoke with both roommates about the dispute. The man was primarily upset that the woman had turned off the internet service. The woman wanted the man to move out of the residence. After hearing both accounts, the deputy determined the matter was civil in nature and not criminal, but he tried to offer a resolution by suggesting the man leave the residence for a while. The deputy offered the man a ride, but the man did not want to leave without his cats. He tried to call a friend to come get him, but the friend did not answer the phone. The man told the deputy he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and repeatedly said that he would hurt his roommate if he remained there. Based on these recurring statements, the deputy determined the man should be placed in protective custody. The deputy asked if he would speak to mental health workers, and the man declined. During their interactions, the deputy saw what he thought was a rifle inside the residence and a sheathed knife on the man. Around 9:20 a.m., the deputy radioed for backup using a code indicating weapons were present. When the sergeant, an 11-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived at the residence at 9:29 a.m., the deputy had the man step outside. As the sergeant, who was also wearing a body camera, approached, the deputy reiterated the statements the man had told him so the sergeant could ascertain the seriousness of the situation. The deputy asked the man about the rifle and knife he observed in the residence; the man said it was a pellet gun and admitted he had a knife. The deputy told the man they were going to take him into custody for a mental health evaluation and began to move near him. The subject began yelling repeatedly that he did not want to deal with “mental health in this county.” The officers ordered him not to reach for anything and repeatedly told him to put his hands behind his head; however, he refused to comply. As the officers talked to the subject in an attempt to calm him, the subject said that someone was coming to pick him up and that he would leave his roommate alone. The subject then advised the officers he was going to reach for his phone. The sergeant warned the subject that reaching for anything would result in a firearm being pointed at him. The sergeant again implored the subject to place his hands on the back of his head. The subject then put his hand on his knife, so the deputy pointed his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun toward the man and notified dispatch “one at gunpoint.” The officers continued to command the subject to put his hands on his head, and at one point the subject replied, “No! You’re going to have to shoot.” Around 9:34 a.m., the sergeant moved toward the subject in an effort to subdue him; the subject pulled his knife from its sheath. The deputy called dispatch again for backup. The sergeant attempted to control the subject’s hands, but he maneuvered the knife and stabbed the sergeant on the top of both hands and wrists. The sergeant lost his grip, and the deputy then engaged in a physical confrontation with the subject, attempting to pull him down. As the officers tried to gain control of the subject, he turned and stabbed the sergeant in the left side of his back. The blade penetrated the sergeant’s uniform and partially penetrated his ballistic vest; the body armor prevented the blade from piercing the sergeant’s skin. The subject turned and attacked the deputy with the knife, resulting in a 6-inch cut on the left side of the deputy’s head. The subject fell to the ground but got back up and rushed several feet toward the deputy, who attempted to pull his weapon and stand up before the subject reached him. The subject tried to stab the deputy in his lower left chest; however, the deputy backed up and the subject cut the deputy’s shirt cuff. The subject again turned toward the sergeant, who had drawn his duty weapon and was attempting to get to his feet as the subject raised the knife above his head. The subject was almost on top of the sergeant when the sergeant fired his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded subject fell to the ground. The sergeant also fell to the ground. The deputy, who was approximately 10 feet from the subject, noticed the subject was trying to get up, so he fired three rounds from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, further incapacitating the subject. At 9:35 a.m., the sergeant told dispatchers that shots were fired, an officer was down, and medical attention was needed. The sergeant and deputy ordered the subject, who had risen to his hands and knees, to stay down, but he continued to disregard commands. The subject laid down, but continued roll around. The deputy readied his electronic control device and retrieved the knife from the ground near the subject’s feet. At about 9:38 a.m., law enforcement officers began arriving on scene. A police officer with the Crescent City Police Department placed the subject in handcuffs. Ambulance crews arrived and began treating the deputy and the subject, who were both taken to a local hospital by ambulance. The sergeant was taken to a local hospital by DNCSO deputies. The deputy received 10 staples in his head, and the sergeant received three stitches in his hand. They were released from the hospital and have returned to duty.
