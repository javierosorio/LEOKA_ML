"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault. The suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, turned the handgun on himself and committed suicide. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The K-9 survived its injury.",954
"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290
"A 30-year-old patrol officer with the Sandusky Police Department was shot and killed on March 19 while attempting to make a traffic stop. Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was treated at a nearby hospital, but died from the wound to his upper back from a round that entered through the armhole of his vest. The offender was also treated for his injuries and later charged with Aggravated Murder, Having a Weapon While Under Disability, and Carrying a Concealed Weapon. The offender was known to police and had a prior criminal history including violent crime, murder, drug violations, police assault, and weapons violations.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence. After a standoff of several hours, SWAT officers arrested the alleged shooter without further incident. He was charged with Murder.",196
"On August 12 around 3:40 p.m., a 33-year-old patrol officer with the Hatch Police Department was fatally wounded while making a traffic stop. The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects. The 38-year-old man who allegedly shot the victim officer was charged with Murder, Possession of a Firearm, Firing Weapon, and Carjacking. He was under the influence of narcotics and on probation at the time of the incidents and had a prior criminal record which included a murder. The victim officer was airlifted to a nearby hospital where he died later that day.",798
"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene. Following the suicide, investigators discovered the suspect had killed his estranged wife as she sat in her vehicle before the officers had arrived. He had a previous criminal record that included drug violations, violent crime, and weapons violations.",1124
"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The suspect was subsequently found unconscious in his jail cell and later died. The cause of death had not been determined at the time of this report.",624
"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31. The deceased offender was later found to have marijuana and cocaine in a bag tied to his belt and concealed in his clothes.

"On September 11 at 10:26 p.m., a 34-year-old agent with the Police of Puerto Rico, Playa Precinct, was killed in an armed robbery in Ponce. The off-duty agent, a law enforcement veteran with 7 years’ experience, was inside a café. Outside the establishment, two suspects robbed four patrons who were playing dominoes, taking their money and jewelry. The first offender, gloved and wearing a bandana over his lower face, was carrying a handgun; the second offender had a knife.

"On April 10 around 11:30 a.m., a Rotterdam Police Department (RPD) patrol officer was assaulted while responding to a call concerning a man with a mental illness. The 43-year-old officer, a veteran with 18 years of law enforcement experience, and a sergeant also with the RPD were dispatched to check the welfare of a mentally ill man. The man’s mother called and said her son was damaging property inside her residence. The man was a military veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had not been taking his medication. Due to the nature of the call, the sergeant requested a Schenectady County Sheriff’s unit also be dispatched. The three officers arrived and spoke with the man’s mother outside of the residence before attempting to contact the man. The mother stated her son had a knife in each hand and was making stabbing motions at her. As the three officers approached the residence, the sergeant and the sheriff’s deputy had their electronic control weapons (ECWs) drawn. The officer also had his service weapon ready. The sergeant called for the man to come out from the front doorway. After receiving no response, the sergeant entered and began searching for the man, calling to him throughout the residence. The sergeant and the officer located the man in a first floor bedroom hiding behind a door. The sergeant noticed a knife on a dresser inside the room. He reached in, grabbed the knife, and threw it down the hallway. The officer called out for the man to drop any weapons he had, but he verbally refused. The sergeant pushed open the door, pinning the man between the door and the wall. The officer continued to order him to drop any weapons and come out. The man then pushed the door, knocking the sergeant backward into the hallway, almost completely closing the door. Then, with a knife in his hand, the man forced open the door and stabbed at the sergeant. The sergeant deployed his ECW, but it had no effect. (It was later determined only one probe struck the man.) The man then turned to the officer and began stabbing at him, striking him in the rear of his head with the knife blade, leaving a 5-inch laceration which later required stitches.

The 30-year-old man, who has a prior criminal record, was pronounced dead at the scene.",1165
"An off-duty detective with the Baltimore Police Department was fatally wounded in an ambush just before 2 a.m. on November 23. The 37-year-old detective along with four acquaintances had just left an establishment where he was working security. As the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience approached his car, two men walked across the parking lot, produced handguns, and shot multiple rounds at the detective from less than 5 feet away. The detective, who was attempting to draw his weapon, was hit in the arms and hands, back, stomach, and fatally in the chest, and fell to the ground with his gun next to him. One of the detective’s acquaintances, who also worked at the establishment, picked up the gun and chased the two men on foot. The detective’s acquaintances got into a car, called 911, and then proceeded to chase the suspects’ vehicle. After a short car chase, the suspects stopped the vehicle, exited, and fled on foot. The detective’s acquaintances also stopped, exited their vehicle, and exchanged gunfire with the suspects as they chased them on foot. When police officers arrived at the scene of the foot chase, they canvassed the area. A woman told the officers she saw someone go into a nearby building. The investigating officers heard a noise coming from inside the building and ordered the person to come out. The man complied, and officers took the 21-year-old male into custody. The officers located a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun in the building. A responding officer found the victim detective’s body and called a medical unit. The victim detective was transported to a local hospital and died less than an hour after the incident. Later that morning the two suspects, a 34- year-old male and a 22- year-old male, were arrested at the home of one of their friends. In interviews with investigators, the suspects revealed that they conspired to kill the detective because they believed the detective was responsible for arresting one of the men’s brothers. Through further investigation, authorities determined that the 9 mm pistol used in the murder of the detective was among items that had been stolen during a burglary of the home of a police officer earlier that month. A revolver was also recovered during the investigation, but laboratory technicians were unable to verify that it was used in this incident. The 21-year-old and 22-year-old suspects, both with prior drug possession arrests, were each charged with First- Degree Murder, Handgun on Person, Handgun Violation-Use/Felonious-Violent Crime, Conspiracy to Commit Murder First Degree, and Illegal Possession of a Firearm.

"The 55-year-old police chief of the Rainier Police Department, a 20-year veteran of law enforcement, was killed with his service weapon while attempting to make an arrest on January 5. Approximately 10:45 a.m., the chief responded to a call from a local car stereo shop reporting a man would not leave the shop. Upon arrival, the chief found the subject sitting in the driver’s seat of a display vehicle parked inside the store’s showroom. When the subject refused to leave at the chief’s request, a physical altercation occurred. The chief was knocked to the ground and appeared to be injured. A store employee and two customers attempted to help the chief, and the reporting employee again called 911 for additional assistance. While the chief was lying on his back, the subject seized the chief’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot the chief once in the head at close range. The two customers and the employee fled the store, fearing the offender would also shoot them. Additional officers arrived on the scene and exchanged gunfire with the man. After he was wounded by return fire, the subject surrendered to law enforcement. The victim chief was flown via helicopter to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The 22-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record, was treated for his injuries and released to law enforcement later that week. He was arrested and charged with Aggravated Murder.",1017
"A 24-year-old police officer with the Urbandale Police Department (UPD) was shot and killed in an ambush (entrapment and premeditation) just after 1 a.m. on November 2. A short time later, a 38-year- old sergeant with the Des Moines Police Department (DMPD) was killed in a similar attack. While the UPD officer was on patrol, dispatchers received reports of shots fired. The UPD officer had not been dispatched to an incident nor had he contacted dispatchers with any type of self-initiated activity. Civilians found the victim officer, who had 1 year of law enforcement experience, sitting in his patrol vehicle. He had fatal gunshot wounds to the side of his head, as well as wounds to the front upper torso/chest from rounds that penetrated his body armor—the rounds exceeded the vest’s specifications. Minutes later, in Des Moines, the DMPD sergeant was killed in a similar attack as he sat in his patrol vehicle. The victim sergeant, a 15-year veteran of law enforcement, suffered wounds to the front of his head, neck/throat, front upper torso/chest, rear upper torso/back, and arms/hands. Rounds also penetrated the victim sergeant’s body armor because they exceeded the vest’s specifications. Investigators discovered approximately 27 rounds were fired at the victim officer, and about 30 rounds were fired at the victim sergeant. All of the rounds came from a 5.56 mm semiautomatic rifle. Investigators quickly identified a suspect, who was captured in a nearby county a few hours after the shootings.

He had a prior criminal record, which included a violent crime, but had no known relationship with either victim officer.",217
"Two veteran police officers with the Mamaroneck Police Department (MPD) were stabbed and injured while answering a call for service on the afternoon of April 28. At 1:29 p.m., an MPD dispatcher received a 911 call from a frantic woman reporting someone was dying at a residence. The dispatcher sent all MPD units and an ambulance to the residence. Multiple officers responded around the same time and encountered a woman who was crying hysterically and saying “my daughter, my grandbaby” repeatedly. She led officers to a side door and gave them the keys to unlock it, as her hands were shaking too badly to do it herself. A group of four officers entered the kitchen, and one of them announced “police” loudly multiple times. In an attempt to clear the house, the officers split up. A 33-year-old police officer, who had 9 years of law enforcement experience, went downstairs with his weapon drawn to secure the basement, where he observed blood spots on the wet floor and a bathtub filled with bloody water in a bathroom. At the same time upstairs, officers walked down a hallway where they saw two closed doors and a number of handwritten notes stuck to the walls with unclear phrases written on them. They opened the first door and found a small, unresponsive child covered by a small blanket or towel and lying on a bed. Her cover included a note that appeared to ask God to accept “my baby.” The 53-year-old officer, who had 17 years of law enforcement experience, immediately started performing CPR on the child and radioed for EMS assistance; the other two officers continued clearing the house. The officers opened the second closed door and encountered a woman standing in the darkened bedroom holding both hands behind her back. She had a bleeding cut on her neck and was staring blankly at the officers. They repeatedly ordered the woman to show her hands, but she did not comply or speak. Additional officers arrived at the scene. Another officer switched places with the 53-year-old officer, and took over performing CPR on the child. The 53-year-old officer then entered the second bedroom with his weapon drawn and ordered the woman to show her hands and get on the floor. The officer had a light mounted on his firearm, which helped him clearly see the woman. As the 53-year-old officer started to switch his firearm for an electronic control device, the woman raised her hands above her head, clutching a large knife in each hand, and ran toward the officers. By this time, the 33-year-old officer had cleared the downstairs and joined the other officers. He and another officer deployed their electronic control devices, striking the suspect in her middle back and side. However, the shock had no effect on the woman. The suspect charged the officers, wildly swinging both knives. The officers backed away and used their arms to deflect the knives, then tripped and fell to the ground. The offender continued to slash at the officers, while they tried to kick the knives away from her. A third officer fired three rounds at the suspect, striking her twice and stopping her attack. The 53-year-old officer suffered a laceration to his left hand, and the 33-year-old officer was stabbed in the foot. Emergency services personnel arrived and began treating the injured offender while the 53-year-old officer returned to the child, who had no pulse, and began chest compressions again. Other officers began clearing the house. Another officer took over CPR on the child, while the 53-year-old officer returned to his patrol unit to retrieve his K-9 partner to help clear the building. On the second floor, the K-9 picked up the scent of a person behind a closed, locked door. An unarmed man exited the room with his hands up, and the officer handcuffed him. Officers later determined the man was a tenant and had nothing to do with the incident. Emergency personnel cleaned and bandaged both officers’ wounds and removed the deceased child to a waiting ambulance. Both officers went to a local hospital where they were treated and released. They have since returned to duty. The 28-year-old suspect, who was the mother of the deceased child, was arrested and charged with Second-Degree Murder, Second-Degree Assault, and Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer. She had no prior criminal record, but she was known to law enforcement for previous domestic violence calls.",191

None of the officers’ rounds struck the suspect; however, one of the suspect’s rounds fatally struck the veteran patrol officer, who had 22 years of law enforcement experience, in the front of the head. The officers quickly moved the victim officer away from the scene and transported him to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced deceased.

The officer, who was 32 years old and had 7 years of law enforcement experience at the time of the incident, was assisting a detective at an apartment where he had located three suspects in a crime spree. A robbery victim had led the detective to the residence, and the DPD officer had been dispatched around 10 a.m. as backup. The three suspects had been arrested and handcuffed, and the detective had stepped outside to talk to the robbery victim. One suspect complained to the officer that his handcuffs were too tight. The officer, who was wearing body armor, loosened the handcuffs. This allowed the suspect to gain access to his own .38-caliber revolver and shoot the veteran officer in the face. The suspect then gained control of the officer’s service weapon and attempted to shoot the victim officer a second time. However, the officer’s weapon was equipped with a “magna trigger” which required a magnetic ring (which was worn by the victim officer) in order to fire. The suspect, believing the weapon to be defective, dropped it at the scene, and all three suspects escaped by leaping from the window.

Minutes earlier, the WPD received several 911 calls about a robbery in progress at a local department store. The first officer to arrive at the scene observed a man leaving the store carrying a handgun and a black canvas bag.

At 5:50 p.m., the detective with the Sault Sainte Marie Police Department responded to a call to a home where a man with mental health problems had become violent and threatened his family members. The individual had threatened the officers who had initially responded to the scene before barricading himself in the basement of the home. The detective, who knew the offender, tried to communicate with him for several hours. Finally, the detective obtained a chemical agent from another officer and slowly descended the stairs to the dimly lit basement, moving debris along the way. As the detective reached the bottom of the stairs, the man jumped from a concealed area, lunged toward the detective, and stabbed him through the eye with a large knife.

As agents attempted to breach the door of the residence where the suspect was located, the suspect opened fire from inside the building, shooting through the door and striking the investigator in the front lower torso/abdomen below his body armor. Another OBN agent was also injured. Other agents returned gunfire and justifiably killed the 43-year-old suspect, who had prior arrests including a weapons violation and other crime of violence.

The veteran officer, who had nearly 23 years of law enforcement service, had been assigned back-up duty but arrived at the scene in La Quinta just ahead of the deputy who had been dispatched as the primary officer. The call for service had been initiated by the parents of a mentally disturbed man who was creating a problem in the home. When the deputy arrived, he immediately became involved in a verbal and physical altercation with the son, and removed his police side-handle baton in an effort to gain control of the situation. However, the subject, who was considerably larger than the deputy, struggled with the officer, knocking him to the ground and rendering him unconscious.

He had violated the protection order previously and was on conditional release. At the woman’s request, the officers first checked the vacant apartment adjacent to the woman’s residence but found no sign of the man there. The woman then unlocked the door to her apartment, and the North St. Paul officer entered first and was immediately assaulted by the woman’s ex-husband. The officer pushed the woman and her daughter away from the attack, and he then was struck in the face with a burning rag that the man was wielding. In the altercation that ensued between the two officers and the man, the man managed to remove the North St. Paul officer’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster and shoot the officer once in the side of his head.

The 38-year-old trooper, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a car for a headlight violation on a road near a major parkway in Atlanta. The driver pulled over to the right shoulder of the road, and the trooper approached the driver’s side door. After checking the trunk to ensure that it was secure, the trooper asked the driver to roll down the rear window, presumably because the window was tinted and he could not see inside the vehicle. The driver failed to comply with the request, and instead put the car into gear and fled. The trooper radioed for assistance and gave chase in his patrol car.

A short time earlier, a WCPD officer responded to a report of an impaired man in a vehicle. The officer parked his patrol unit next to the man’s vehicle and approached the driver’s side door. The subject placed his vehicle in reverse, and the vehicle rolled backwards onto an adjacent street. The officer took hold of the side mirror and stopped the rolling vehicle. The subject was fidgeting and yelling, so the officer asked him what was wrong. The man ignored the officer and continued his erratic behavior. The officer asked the man to exit the vehicle, but the subject did not comply and stated he needed to make a phone call because he was out of gas. Tinted windows prevented the officer from seeing clearly inside the vehicle, so he called for backup.

The subject repeated that he wanted to make a call, so one of the officers offered to make the call if the man would put down the knife. Once again, the subject ignored the officer and continued to rant and complain. A WCPD sergeant arrived at the scene and asked the man what was wrong; he replied that the officers were trying to take him back to jail. During their conversation, the subject placed the knife on the vehicle seat. While distracting the man by talking to him, the sergeant passed his electronic control device behind his back to one of the other officers.

Arrest him.” Before the detectives could react, the suspect opened fire with a .38-caliber revolver. The HU and SVU detectives were struck. The HU detective was hit in the front lower torso/abdomen and rear lower torso/back and the SVU detective was hit in the front lower torso/abdomen and in his arms/hands. The SVU detective was knocked to the ground; while on the street, he observed that the suspect had exited the porch of the residence and was headed directly toward him, continuing to fire. The wounded SVU detective drew his service weapon and fired at the suspect, striking him. The suspect fell to the ground, sat back up, and again raised his revolver in the direction of the detective. The SVU detective again fired at the suspect, striking him a second time. The suspect fell to the ground again, and this time dropped his weapon. During the exchange of gunfire, the wounded HU detective made his way back to his vehicle and radioed for backup and medical assistance. The wounded SVU detective, with assistance from the CSU detective, subdued and handcuffed the suspect. At 9:02 a.m., the 23-year-old suspect, who was known to use and possess drugs and had prior arrests for violent crime, weapons violations, and drug violations, was pronounced dead at the scene. The SVU detective has since recovered from his injuries and returned to duty. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the HU detective had not returned to duty.",1153
"On August 9, a deputy sheriff from the Mahnomen County Sheriff’s Office succumbed to gunshot wounds he received on February 18, 2009, while investigating suspicious circumstances. At the time of the incident, the 26-year-old deputy, who had more than 5 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a call at 7:10 a.m. reporting that shots had been fired in the city of Mahnomen. Upon his arrival at the scene, the deputy encountered two men in a driveway. The deputy exited his vehicle and approached the two individuals, at which time a physical altercation ensued. During the struggle, the deputy, who was wearing body armor, was shot twice in the abdomen and once in the back of his head with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. A second deputy arrived on scene and returned fire on the suspects, hitting one suspect in the abdomen. The assisting deputy called for an ambulance for the wounded deputy. The two suspects fled to a residence across the street and a standoff ensued. Nine hours later, both suspects surrendered peacefully and were arrested. One suspect, a 32-year-old man, was initially charged with Attempted Murder. The other suspect, a 27-year-old man, was charged with a Felon Convicted of a Crime of Violence, Possession of a Weapon, First-Degree Assault, Use of Deadly Force Against a Law Enforcement Officer, Attempted Theft of a Motor Vehicle Without Consent, Failure to Render Aid/Assistance, and Contempt of Court. It was determined that both individuals were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the shooting. Both suspects also had prior criminal records that included violent crimes and weapons violations. When the victim deputy eventually died as the result of the gunshot wound to the back of his head, the suspect’s Attempted Murder charge was increased to Second-Degree Murder.",814
"A deputy sheriff with the Grundy County Sheriff’s Office was killed and a patrol officer with the Monteagle Police Department was injured while attempting to arrest an individual at approximately 3 a.m. on June 5 in Monteagle. The 29-year-old deputy had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, and the 23-year-old patrol officer had 2 years of law enforcement experience. The pair, along with a reserve police officer, were at a residence to serve an individual with a warrant for a misdemeanor violation of probation. The deputy went to the front door of the residence, and the patrol officer and reserve officer went to the back door. The man let the deputy inside and then asked if he could change clothes, and the deputy agreed. The man went into a rear bedroom, and the deputy remained in the living room with the man’s girlfriend. The deputy asked the woman if the man had a gun, and she acknowledged that he did. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, then went to the bedroom. As he crossed the threshold to the room, the man fired a shot at the deputy from a .38-caliber revolver, striking the deputy at close range fatally in the right temple. The suspect took the deputy’s service weapon, a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and fled. Outside, the patrol officer heard the scuffle and attempted to go to the front door but tripped and fell in the dark in the yard of the residence. As the suspect was fleeing, he fired two rounds, one of which struck the patrol officer in the right side of the torso when the bullet entered through the armhole area of his protective vest. The reserve officer called for assistance and emergency aid, and the wounded patrol officer was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and released and then returned to duty the next day. The suspect fled into a wooded area behind the residence armed with the revolver, a 12-gauge shotgun, and the deputy sheriff’s service weapon. After an extensive search by local, state, and federal agencies from three states, officers found the suspect in a wooded area near a local cemetery. Attempts to negotiate with the suspect were unsuccessful. At approximately 6:55 p.m., the 29-year-old suspect committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. The suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and had prior convictions for drugs.",505
"An investigator with the Rockdale County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack at 12:55 p.m. on May 8. The 28-year-old investigator, with nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, along with other investigators and a deputy, were attempting to serve an arrest warrant on an individual at a residence in Conyers. The warrant was for Rape, Aggravated Assault, and Kidnapping stemming from an incident the previous evening. The entire house had been cleared except for the rear master bedroom. The door to that room was locked and had to be breached to gain entry. Once inside the room, all visible areas were cleared except for the closet, which was closed and did not have a doorknob. When the investigator pulled open the door, the 41-year-old male began firing a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the victim investigator twice. The first shot entered through his left forearm and was stopped by his protective vest. The second shot fatally struck him on the left side below the vest in the front lower torso/stomach. Two other investigators and one deputy returned fire, killing the suspect, who had a prior criminal record.",596
"On February 2 at 8:37 p.m., a 42-year-old deputy sheriff was killed, and a 48-year-old lieutenant was wounded, both with the Clermont County Sheriff’s Office, when they responded to a report of an armed suicidal subject who had barricaded himself inside his residence at a Pierce Township apartment complex. The incident began at 7 p.m. Both officers were veterans of law enforcement; the deputy had 22 years of experience, and the lieutenant had 23 years of experience. Around 8:30 p.m., responding officers were negotiating with the subject when they heard him inside the apartment counting down an alleged suicide threat followed immediately by shots fired. A small group of officers with the Clermont County Special Response Team (CCSRT) decided to breach the door of the residence to attempt life- saving measures. During the breach attempt, the subject fired a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle, fatally wounding the deputy and injuring the lieutenant. Neither of the officers fired on the offender. The offender fired 23 rounds from a distance of 8 feet, wounding the deputy in the front upper torso/chest, rear lower torso/back, and on the front and rear of his legs. The fatal round entered below his body armor in his lower back area. The lieutenant, who was also wearing body armor, was wounded in the front of his legs; he was treated at a local hospital and released. Officers called the entire CCSRT and the Cincinnati SWAT team for backup. During the prolonged standoff, the offender fired multiple rounds at CCSRT vehicles. The CCSRT launched numerous canisters of gas into the residence in an attempt to safely extract the offender. When a fire erupted inside the residence at 6 a.m. on February 3, the offender surrendered and was taken into custody. The 23-year- old offender, who was under the influence of cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamines/methamphetamines at the time of the incident, was charged, and later indicted and arraigned, on a Weapons Law Violation, Aggravated Murder, and multiple counts of Attempted Murder. His criminal history included a drug law violation, robbery, and a weapons violation. The wounded lieutenant has since recovered from his injury and has returned to duty.",836
"On April 4, a detective with the Jackson Police Department was shot and killed while interviewing a homicide suspect around 5:45 p.m. at police headquarters. A camera inside the interrogation room captured the incident on video. During his interview with two detectives, a homicide suspect became belligerent and engaged one of the detectives in a struggle. The 40-year-old detective was a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 18 years’ experience. As the two fell to the floor, the suspect managed to get the detective’s service weapon, a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The other detective in the room fired a shot that missed the suspect. Then her service weapon malfunctioned, so she ran from the room to summon help. As the struggle continued, the suspect shot the detective once, rose to his feet, and fired three more rounds at the detective. The rounds hit the victim detective in his arms/hands and mortally wounded him in the front upper torso/chest. The 23-year-old assailant, who had a prior criminal record that included violent crime, then committed suicide by shooting himself twice in the head. A sergeant with the Tupelo Police Department (TPD) was killed and a TPD officer was wounded while responding to a robbery in progress at a local bank around 3:20 p.m. on December 23. Both were veterans of law enforcement; the 38-year-old sergeant had more than 8 years of experience and the 27- year-old officer had 5 years of experience. Shortly after 3 p.m., a man wearing a face mask and armed with a handgun entered a bank. The man placed a wedge in the front door to prevent it from closing before entering the tellers’ area through an employees-only door. The man directed the bank tellers to back away as he filled a black bag with cash from the tellers’ drawers. An undisclosed amount of money was taken. The suspect then exited through the same employee door, stopped to retrieve the wedge used to prop the front door open, and fled from the bank’s parking lot in a gray sedan. The sergeant and the officer responded to the alarm at the bank and to a report that the suspect had fled in a white sport utility vehicle (SUV). While en route to the bank, the officers observed a white SUV stalled in traffic and stopped to address the driver. While the officers talked to the driver of the SUV, the suspect exited his gray sedan that was stopped behind the white SUV and fired six rounds at the officers with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The sergeant fired his service weapon, but was fatally wounded when the suspect fired a round that entered through the armhole/shoulder area of the sergeant’s body armor and pierced his front upper torso/chest. The officer was also struck, and injured in the back of the head. The suspect re-entered his vehicle and fled the scene. At this time, the suspect’s identity and whereabouts were unknown. Law enforcement officials released bank surveillance photos of the suspect and the vehicle to the public. As the investigation developed, the suspect was linked to an attempted bank robbery in Atlanta, Georgia, that had occurred earlier the same day. The bank robbery in Atlanta had been unsuccessful, but the suspect had robbed a customer at an ATM in the vestibule of the bank before fleeing in a gray sedan. On December 26, the FBI established a tip line for the case and announced a financial reward was available for information leading to the identification and capture of the subject. On December 28, the suspect attempted to rob another bank in Phoenix, Arizona. As officers responded to the call, the suspect immediately engaged the first uniformed patrol officer on scene by firing his weapon at the patrol vehicle while the officer was still inside. A second responding officer shot and justifiably killed the suspect. Further investigation revealed that the suspect committed all three robberies in Atlanta, Tupelo, and Phoenix. The 40-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured officer had not returned to duty.",793
"A 48-year-old police officer with the Texas Tech Police Department (TTPD) was shot and killed around 7:45 p.m. on October 9 at the university’s police station while he was processing an individual suspected of firing a weapon in a dormitory. Earlier in the day, around 3:30 p.m., the officer, who had 5 months of law enforcement experience, arrived at a Texas Tech University (TTU) dormitory suite with another officer to investigate a reported odor of marijuana. The officers knocked on the suite door; however, no one answered, so they left. Approximately 2 hours later, the officer and a different backup officer went to the student union building and met with two TTU students, who lived in the same suite the officers had been to earlier. The students reported one of their suitemates had discharged a firearm inside his dorm room around 2 a.m. that morning. The officers returned to the dormitory suite to conduct a welfare check shortly before 6 p.m. They entered the dorm room and saw evidence of drug use and a pellet pistol in plain view, but the student who lived in the room was not there. The officers were collecting the items in plain sight when the student returned. Based on the visible evidence in the room, the officers searched the student, handcuffed him, and transported him to the TTU police station. In the briefing room, the officer was completing the paperwork required to transport the student to the Lubbock County Jail. The student requested to use the restroom, and the officer removed the handcuffs. The student attempted to enter a private restroom stall but was not allowed to do so. The student was escorted back to the briefing room and sat back down next to the officer, who was wearing body armor. Without warning, the student produced a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his pants and fired one round, mortally wounding the officer in the right side of his head. The suspect then fled the police station on foot. Officers set up a containment perimeter and took the suspect into custody less than 2 hours later. The 19-year-old suspect, who had a previous arrest for an alcohol violation, was known to possess a controlled substance and alcohol. He was arrested and charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.",47
"A 50-year-old captain with the Grenada Police Department (GPD) was killed during a traffic pursuit around 8:55 a.m. on October 7. That morning, the Grenada County Sheriff’s Office (GCSO) received a call from a woman who saw two men break into a building next to a church then leave in a vehicle. GCSO deputies en route saw the vehicle and attempted to conduct a traffic stop. However, the driver refused to stop, so the deputies pursued the vehicle and notified the GPD that they were headed towards the town of Grenada. The captain, a 25-year veteran of law enforcement, responded and parked his vehicle at the side of the highway. He exited his vehicle and was positioned near the trunk, perhaps to retrieve a tire-deflation device, when he was fatally struck by the suspect’s vehicle traveling approximately 100 mph. The suspect’s vehicle then crashed into a ditch. The victim captain, who was wearing a protective vest, suffered injuries to his front below the waist and to his front upper torso/chest. The 20-year-old driver of the vehicle had a criminal record that included violent crime and drug violations. His 41-year- old passenger also had a criminal record, which included charges for drug violations and police assault. Both men were arrested and charged with Capital Murder, Felony Fleeing, Burglary, and Possession of Stolen Property.",456
"A sergeant with the City of Andrews Department of Public Safety’s drug task force died of injuries sustained at 9:30 a.m. on May 16 while confronting an individual aboard a long-distance commercial bus in Pecos. The 38-year- old sergeant, with more than 9 years of experience in law enforcement, boarded the bus with two other officers to con- duct a routine drug interdiction operation. The sergeant walked to the back of the bus and began questioning a man who, unknown to officials at the time, was a wanted felon. The man drew a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired twice at the victim officer at close range, striking him in the back and fatally in the chest. The other officers fired three shots at the suspect, striking and killing him. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital and then to a Lubbock hospital where he died of his injuries about 8 hours later.

"A 33-year-old police officer with the Columbus Division of Police was shot and killed on January 6 while working special duty at a bank. Just after 10:30 a.m., a masked man entered the bank with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and ordered customers and employees to the floor. The man then ran toward the teller’s counter with the weapon pointed toward the employees and fired seven times at the officer who was standing behind the counter. The bullets entered the officer’s front upper torso above his protective vest. Despite being shot, the officer returned fire and wounded the 29-year-old would-be robber who fled the scene without any money. The victim officer, who had over 8 years of law enforcement experience, died at the scene. The suspect, who had a prior criminal record, was arrested without incident on January 9 while hiding in the basement of a residence in Columbus.

"Just before noon on December 8, a deputy sheriff with the Moore County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed while attempting an arrest in Vass. The 58-year-old deputy, who had more than 37 years of law enforcement experience, went to a residence to investigate a report from a neighbor about trespassers at a home, which was in foreclosure and abandoned. He notified dispatch that he was at the home and asked dispatchers to check the license plate of a vehicle that was parked on the property. As the deputy approached the home, he met an individual who identified himself as the homeowner’s brother. The brother and the deputy entered the home and located the potential homeowner. The veteran deputy explained the reason for his presence and requested identification. The individual did not respond or make an attempt to comply with the deputy’s request; therefore, the deputy radioed for backup. The brother asked the individual where his identification was so that he could get it for the deputy, and the man stated that it was in his vehicle. At the deputy’s request, they all went outside. The individual and the deputy stood on the porch while the brother retrieved the identification from the vehicle. The brother provided the identification to the deputy, who relayed the information to the dispatcher. The deputy received notification over the radio that there was an outstanding warrant for child support for the individual. As the deputy removed handcuffs from his belt and informed the man that he was under arrest for a child support warrant, the man pulled a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from behind his back and fired twice, striking the deputy in the rear upper torso/back and fatally in the side of the head. The 33-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record and prior mental disorders, committed suicide by shooting himself once in the head. When the backup deputy arrived, he heard the two gunshots but did not see the incident.",1163
"The 48-year-old sheriff of the Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed in an ambush at 7:15 p.m. on April 13. The officer, with 28 years’ experience in law enforcement, was leaving a benefit dinner in the city of Somerset. The officer, in uniform and wearing body armor, was unlocking the door to his police car when a single shot from a .25-06-caliber bolt-action rifle apparently fired from a wooded area more than 250 feet away fatally struck him in the side of the head. The assailant was seen leaving the area on a motorcycle. Police apprehended and arrested a 30-year-old suspect, who was a known narcotics user, a short time later in a rural area of the county.

"Approximately 3:30 on a summer afternoon in the Northeast, an officer, who had 13 years of law enforcement experience, faced an unprovoked attack while checking a local park during his routine patrol. Unknown to the officer, three offenders broke into a business earlier that day, stole several firearms, and loaded them into a stolen truck. Before the break-in, the offenders had left their personal vehicle at the park with plans to exchange the stolen firearms from the stolen truck to their personal vehicle. During this exchange, the officer pulled into the park's parking lot. The three offenders saw the approaching officer and ran to hide. Two of the offenders hid just inside the nearby wood line while the third offender attempted to hide under the truck. The officer exited his patrol vehicle and approached the front of the truck where he saw the 22-year-old offender, who was partially hidden under the truck. The offender fired 13 rounds from a .40-caliber semiautomatic firearm, striking the officer several times, causing him to fall. The offender then got into his vehicle and backed over the officer. One of the other offenders, also 22 years of age, left the wood line, approached the downed officer, and used the officer's .40-caliber semiautomatic firearm to shoot him three times in the head, killing him. The offenders then rummaged through the officer's vehicle and stole some items before fleeing the area. A couple of days later, the offenders were arrested. Two of the offenders were sentenced to life in prison.",1225
"A 42-year-old patrol officer with the San Leandro Police Department was killed on July 25 while investigating a disturbance call. Around 11 p.m., the officer, who had nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, was called to a residence where a gathering had sparked complaints of noise and loitering. When the officer arrived at the home, he requested the identifications of several of the people present, including a man who lived there. As the officer was in the process of obtaining this information, he turned his attention away from that individual. Apparently, the man pulled a 10 mm semiautomatic handgun from his waistband and shot the officer in the side of his head.

"Around 9:50 a.m. on February 25, two deputy sheriffs with the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office (FCSO) were shot and injured while serving a search warrant at a residence in Minkler. Approximately an hour later, while responding to the “officer down” call, a corporal with the Reedley Police Department (RPD) was also shot. One of the FCSO deputies and the RPD corporal subsequently died as a result of injuries sustained. The two deputies initially attempted to serve a search warrant at the residence of a person of interest concerning several arsons and shootings in the Minkler area. Apparently, the suspect opened fire on the deputies with a rifle while they were outside the home. The 49-year-old veteran deputy, who had nearly 12 years of law enforcement experience, was hit in the chest by a round that entered his body armor through the armhole. The second deputy was grazed on the face by one of the rounds fired. Both victim deputies were transported to a regional medical center where the 49-year-old deputy died at 10:26 a.m. as the result of his gunshot wound; the other deputy was treated and released.

"On July 9, shortly after 9:30 a.m., a 43-year-old sergeant with the Mt. Juliet Police Department and a 49- year-old deputy with the Wilson County Sheriff’s Department were killed while attempting to assist other law enforcement officers in pursuit of a subject driving a stolen vehicle. Earlier that morning, officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol discontinued a high-speed chase near Knoxville when the subject, who was wanted for a felony, struck a pursuing unit with the stolen vehicle in order to escape. Responding to the new report, units from the Wilson County Sheriff’s Department became involved in a second pursuit on an interstate near Mt. Juliet. The sergeant from the local police department, who had more than 13 years of law enforcement experience, and the deputy from the county agency, who had more than 15 years of experience, deployed a spike strip in order to stop the stolen vehicle. When the driver of the stolen car neared the spike strip, she swerved and struck both officers, who were standing by their patrol cars on the shoulder of the road, killing them instantly. The driver of the stolen vehicle, a 21-year-old woman who was on probation and had several prior arrests including Motor Vehicle Theft, Criminal Impersonation, and Reckless Driving and Reckless Endangerment, was under the influence of a controlled substance. She and a 33-year-old woman, who was also in the stolen vehicle, sustained injuries in the crash and were taken to a local hospital. The driver of the car was treated and released into the custody of law enforcement officers who transported her to a local jail. She was charged with two counts of Premeditated First-Degree Murder and two counts of Felony First-Degree Murder. The other woman remained in the hospital with a broken leg. Prosecutors did not charge the passenger of the vehicle with any crimes; she eventually provided information against the driver. An officer of the Memphis Police Department was shot at 7:30 p.m., on August 27 while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Approximately 30 minutes prior to the incident, a man went to his girlfriend’s apartment and began arguing with her. When the woman’s sister arrived at the apartment just a few minutes later, she feared for her sister’s safety and called 911. Allegedly, the man threatened to shoot somebody if either woman called 911, but the sister apparently managed to make the call and stay out of the man’s way while she waited for help to arrive. At 7:20 p.m., the 34-year-old officer was the first to arrive on the scene. When he knocked on the apartment door, the man and his girlfriend left the bedroom where they had been arguing, and the man answered the door. The man’s girlfriend stood in the hallway for a few seconds as both men pointed guns at each other, and the officer told the man not to move. The girlfriend then ran into the bathroom, got into the bathtub, and remained there as several gunshots were fired in the hallway. The man shot the 5-year veteran of law enforcement with a .357 magnum revolver two times in the side of the head and two times in the shoulder area, outside the officer’s protective vest. Later investigation revealed that the officer’s ammunition clip apparently separated from his weapon, preventing him from shooting the suspect during the altercation. The suspect then went into the bathroom and shot his girlfriend in the buttocks and then returned to the hallway and took the victim officer’s handgun and ammunition clip. He reentered the bathroom and shot his girlfriend again. After spotting a second officer outside the front of the apartment, the man took both women down the stairs on the opposite side of the building. On the way down the stairs, the woman’s sister broke free and ran to safety. Once the couple got to the bottom of the stairs, the man kissed the woman, walked to the south side of the building, and threw his revolver into the bushes. He returned to the entrance hallway of the apartments, sat down, and tried to shoot himself with the victim officer’s weapon. When the gun did not discharge, the 25-year-old male, who had prior arrests, ejected the round, inserted the officer’s clip, and shot himself in the head. A few minutes later, a third responding officer observed the suspect’s body in the dark hallway holding the victim officer’s weapon, and he ordered the suspect to drop the gun. When the suspect did not put the weapon down, the officer shot him once in the stomach, not knowing that the man was already dead. The fallen officer inside the apartment was subsequently transported to a local hospital where he died at 9 p.m. as a result of the shots he sustained in the head. The suspect’s girlfriend was also transported to the hospital and treated for her gunshot wounds.",881
"A 41-year-old criminal intelligence (CI) officer with the Fort Worth Police Department (FWPD) lost his life shortly after midnight on September 14 while investigating a series of armed robberies occurring at bars and cantinas in the area. Days earlier, robbery detectives identified two possible suspect vehicles—a truck and an SUV—from surveillance video related to two of the robberies. The FWPD CI Unit identified the possible driver of the SUV. On September 9, a robbery detective requested a Special Response Team to locate the vehicle. Officers observed the SUV meet up with a truck matching the description of the second vehicle. The robbery detectives did not have enough information to issue arrest warrants, so they conducted surveillance on the two vehicles. On September 13, officers from the FWPD CI Unit, Criminal Tracking Unit, Special Response Team, and Robbery Unit went out to monitor the two suspect vehicles. At approximately 9:43 p.m., the driver of the SUV picked up another man and drove to an area bar. Officers watched the driver and the passenger examine the bar and residences in the neighborhood. At 10:10 p.m., the subjects drove to a gas station and picked up another passenger. The subjects again observed the bar for about an hour. At 11:28 p.m., the SUV parked at a vacant residence, and the three subjects got out of the vehicle. At this point, the undercover officers lost sight of the subjects. At approximately midnight, the subjects entered the back patio area of the bar through a gate that opened from the alley. Two of the suspects immediately pointed handguns at the customers on the patio, forced them to the ground, and stole their money and wallets. The other suspect ran into the bar, pointed his firearm at the customers inside, and stole their valuables. The undercover officers became aware of the robbery when people began running from the bar. Officers positioned near the front entrance saw a patron run from the bar followed by a masked suspect who pointed a firearm at the patron, then returned to the bar. Meanwhile, uniformed officers in an unmarked van and truck parked close to the front and rear bumpers of the suspects’ SUV. Officers spread out around the vehicle. The suspects fled the bar through the alley and ran toward the SUV, but when they saw the officers, they turned and fled. The officers followed. After spotting two of the suspects near the end of the alley jump up from the ground and run, officers pursed one until they lost sight of him. One officer followed a loud banging sound that came from behind a nearby residence. The officer saw a door had been kicked in and then encountered a suspect standing near the residence. The officer ordered him to put his hands in the air and lie down on the ground. The suspect complied, and officers arrested him.",387
"On April 23 around 3:45 p.m., a 31-year-old deputy sheriff with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office (JCSO) was shot and killed during a tactical situation that resulted from answering a domestic violence call. The deputy, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, was assisting in the investigation of an anonymous call to the Venus Police Department (VPD) reporting that a male had assaulted a female and was possibly armed. The first deputy, along with two other JCSO deputies and an officer from the VPD, arrived at the residence. The first deputy requested that officers position themselves away from the residence for safety. When the officers approached the residence, the first deputy and the VPD officer checked a parked truck for weapons, and the other two deputies knocked at the door. A woman in the residence advised them that the suspect was in a shed at the end of the house. The deputies tried the door to the shed, but it appeared to be locked. They identified themselves as deputies and asked the man they believed to be inside to come out. One deputy and the officer asked the woman if they could open the door, and she gave consent. One of the deputies pulled the door open. Inside a man was sitting against the wall to the left of the door, his hand hidden in a recess in the studded walls. The deputies ordered the man to show his hands. The suspect replied in a desperate voice that he could not. The suspect then began shooting a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The first deputy pushed another deputy back to the left to keep him from getting hit and leaned forward in an attempt to push away the subject’s gun. The first deputy then backed up and moved left to right as the suspect began firing faster. The deputy was struck in the neck and fatally in the front upper torso/chest when a bullet entered the armhole of his body armor, and he fell in front of the door to the shed. A second deputy stepped in front of the body, shielding it and began to fire at the suspect. The third deputy returned gunfire as well, as the suspect continued shooting. The 47-year-old suspect fell and officers ceased firing and handcuffed the wounded suspect, who subsequently died from his injuries. Officers on the scene performed CPR on the victim deputy until backup officers and emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene; however, the deputy died from his injuries.",786

The three officers found the suspect in a back bedroom, sitting on the bed with his hands covered. The officers gave the suspect several commands to show his hands. When the suspect did not comply, the first officer put his gun back in the holster and took out a nonlethal electronic control device (ECD) to incapacitate the suspect while the second officer kept his handgun drawn. As the first officer stepped around the second officer to fire the ECD, the suspect produced a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and shot the first officer in the upper arm.

Earlier that morning, the sergeant and the officers went to a local coffee shop where police often gather to share information and complete required reports. At 8:16 a.m., dispatchers received a 911 call via a mobile phone that reported a man had entered the coffee shop and had fired a gun.

"On the morning of July 18, a 56-year-old sergeant with the Stone County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed while answering a service call for a domestic violence circumstance in Flag. Prior to arriving at the residence, the sergeant briefly met with an assisting deputy and an investigator because he had been advised that the suspect was possibly armed. As they formed a tactical plan, the investigator determined that the suspect had a felony arrest warrant, and the deputy advised that the suspect was known to be a flight risk. Upon their arrival at 8:39 a.m., the sergeant activated his body camera and approached the front entrance of the residence. The investigator covered him with a rifle from behind a car parked nearby, and the deputy covered the back entrance of the residence. The sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with 18 years’ experience, knocked on the front door three times and announced he was with the sheriff’s office. A woman exited the residence and closed the door behind her. The sergeant asked the woman if anyone was inside the residence. Just then, a man armed with a weapon opened the door. The sergeant acknowledged him and told him to put the firearm down. Footage from the sergeant’s body camera showed the suspect raise a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and begin firing rapidly at the sergeant at close range. As he moved from the porch to the ground, the sergeant fired nine rounds, and the investigator behind the car fired three rounds at the suspect. The suspect continued to shoot as he retreated into the residence, and the woman went to her knees on the porch. During the roughly 7-second exchange of gunfire, the suspect fired 12 rounds, seven of which struck the victim sergeant, killing him instantly. Although the sergeant’s body armor stopped one of the rounds, the other six struck the victim sergeant, including a fatal round that entered his front upper torso/chest through the armhole or shoulder area of his protective vest. The five other rounds struck him in his front lower torso/abdomen and rear lower torso/back. Another one of the suspect’s rounds went through the living room wall and struck the woman who was on the porch. The round entered and exited her left arm above her elbow. When the shooting stopped, a witness at the scene entered the residence against the order of the investigator and announced that the suspect was dead. The investigator then located the deceased suspect in a living room chair; he had been justifiably killed by two rounds fired by either the victim sergeant or the investigator. The 39-year-old suspect had a felony warrant, as well as a prior arrest for a drug law violation.",972
"On the morning of March 2, a 50-year-old sergeant with the Fugitive Apprehension Squad of the Glendale Police Department (GPD) was shot and critically wounded while performing undercover surveillance on a subject wanted on two felony warrants. A team of officers from the GPD and a U.S. Marshals’ task force worked together to apprehend the subject. Using GPS coordinates from the subject’s cell phone, task force members located him at a storage facility. The officers then observed the subject running away from the facility towards a strip mall. At 8:18 a.m., the sergeant confronted the subject, who immediately pulled out a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired two rounds at the sergeant, wounding him in the front upper torso/chest with one round. An assisting officer fired three rounds at the offender but missed. The offender fled into the front door of a nearby business and exited out the back door, where another officer fired at him. The offender climbed over a wall into the surrounding neighborhood. Members of the Phoenix Police Department (PPD) and GPD set up a perimeter and again used the offender’s cell phone GPS coordinates to pinpoint his location. Members of the PPD’s special assignment unit and a K-9 began searching the area. As they approached a side gate, an officer observed the offender pointing his handgun at them through a gap in the fence. The officer opened fire, striking and justifiably killing the offender at the scene.

The officer, a 14-year veteran of law enforcement, responded to a call of shots fired. The dispatcher indicated that the suspect had left the scene and provided a description of the suspect’s vehicle. Another officer relayed the likely identity of the suspect, a man already known to law enforcement. Once in the area, the officer saw the suspect’s vehicle headed north near a local shopping center, and he advised other units of its location. Suddenly, the suspect’s vehicle stopped, and the driver exited with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. He fired three rounds at the officer who was seated in his patrol vehicle. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was hit in the arms/hands and the front upper torso/chest. Still in his patrol vehicle, he reported shots fired, and returned fire.

The officer continued to return fire from behind his patrol vehicle. When the suspect no longer fired back, the officer believed he had struck the suspect; however, he maintained cover behind his patrol vehicle. Responding officers set up a perimeter and cleared the shopping center. Officers approached the suspect vehicle, where they found the 50- year-old suspect fatally wounded, slumped over the steering wheel. The officer was taken to a local hospital for treatment.

The 42-year-old veteran sergeant, with 10 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call at 10:45 p.m. concerning an individual shooting paint balls. Officers located the individual in a church parking lot. The man had unloaded a large amount of paintball supplies on the grounds of the church. When the individual spotted officers, he got in his vehicle and tried to flee. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, parked his patrol vehicle to block the exit, got out of the vehicle, and prepared to contact the man. The individual was able to maneuver around the sergeant’s vehicle and fire five rounds from a semiautomatic handgun. One of the rounds struck the sergeant in the front below his waist (upper left thigh). The sergeant returned fire, shooting nine rounds from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, none of which hit the offender.

The suspect repeatedly displayed a weapon during the standoff. Officers fired at and struck the individual many times with less-than-lethal munitions and were eventually able to take the suspect into custody without serious injury. The 47-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record, was arrested and charged with two counts of First-Degree Assault.

At the start of his shift on the morning of December 8, the 37-year- old sergeant was informed about the situation and was dispatched to the scene to accompany Department of Transportation officials to confront the disgruntled residents. Upon his arrival, the sergeant became involved in an altercation with the two men on the porch of the residence, so he called for assistance. During the altercation, one of the residents disarmed the sergeant and shot him with a 7 mm bolt-action rifle in the shoulder area that was unprotected by his body armor. The bullet mortally wounded the veteran officer, who had nearly 8 years of law enforcement service. The victim sergeant’s body was then dragged inside the residence.

The 35-year-old officer, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a residential burglary. At the residence, a witness pointed out an individual walking on railroad tracks nearby. The officer drove his marked patrol unit parallel to the railroad tracks and stopped when he reached the subject. The officer, who was wearing body armor, exited his patrol unit and approached the individual. Almost immediately, a struggle ensued. The officer radioed that he was engaged in a struggle with a subject. The officer’s partner could see the struggle from the site of the burglary and drove to the scene.

During the investigation, authorities discovered that the suspect posted a manifesto on a social media page on February 4 documenting his grievances against the LAPD and his intention to kill specific officers and their families. The suspect was wanted in the February 3 murder of two family members of a retired LAPD officer, a February 6 kidnapping, and a February 7 attempt to kill an LAPD officer that occurred prior to the shooting of the RPD officers. During this time, a massive search effort was underway, and protection details were assigned to potential targets. After killing the RPD officer and wounding that officer’s partner on February 7, the suspect remained at large until 5 days later.

Earlier in the day, two civilians entered a rental cabin where the suspect had been hiding. The suspect fled from that location in the civilians’ vehicle. The SBCSD detective and the SBCSD deputy responded separately to radio traffic advising that the suspect had carjacked another civilian and was now driving a different vehicle. While searching for the suspect’s vehicle, authorities focused their attention on an area near another vacant vacation cabin. Both the detective and deputy arrived at the scene and exited their vehicles. They took cover behind a vehicle while devising a plan to capture the suspect. When the officers stepped out from their positions of cover, the suspect fired at them with a .223-caliber rifle. The detective was shot in the front lower torso/stomach, the front below the waist, and fatally in the neck/throat.
