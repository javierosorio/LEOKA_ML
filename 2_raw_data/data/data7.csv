"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence.

The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects.

"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder.

"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31.

Additional officers and emergency services personnel arrived, and first aid was administered. The victim deputy was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased as a result of the fatal wound to the side of his head. Crime scene investigators found the suspect’s driver’s license on top of the laptop in the victim deputy’s patrol vehicle. Approximately 10 minutes after dispatch was radioed about the victim deputy, they received a 911 call about a home invasion in Ceres. The resident advised that a man had forced his way into his home and announced police were looking for him because he had killed his own family. The suspect brandished a firearm, stole the resident’s vehicle, and fled. Dispatchers issued an updated statewide alert for the suspect and information regarding the latest stolen vehicle. When responding officers arrived, the victim of the robbery had sketched a picture of the robber that officers recognized to be the man wanted for shooting the victim deputy. A helicopter was called in to search for the suspect and the stolen vehicles. The stolen vehicle that was used to flee the shooting scene was found near the area of the home invasion.

"A 26-year-old police officer with the Sacramento Police Department (SPD) was shot and killed during a domestic disturbance call on June 19 at 6:10 p.m. Earlier in the day at 11:43 a.m., an SPD dispatcher received a call from an individual who reported that, although she was uninjured, her live-in boyfriend had hit and pushed her and threatened her with a gun. She advised the dispatcher that there were five guns in the residence, and that her boyfriend routinely carried a pistol in his waistband and frequently threatened her with it. The individual had gone to a friend’s house to place the call and wait for the police to arrive.

The individual advised the officers that she also owned the residence next door. With her consent, the officers went next door, conducted a protective sweep, and located two AR-15 style rifles inside. Officers devised a plan to clear the numerous outbuildings located in both back yards before engaging with the boyfriend. At 6:10 p.m., when the officers began to search a detached garage, the 26-year-old SPD officer stood near the entryway. The suspect opened fire from inside the residence, 50 feet away.

The 62-year-old officer, who had over 6 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence and called for backup. Before the additional officers arrived, the assistant chief apparently confronted the suspect and a struggle ensued. During the altercation, the man seemingly disarmed the assistant chief, taking his .357 magnum revolver and shot him four times, striking him once in his right thigh, twice in his torso, and fatally in the front of his head. Moments later, the responding officers arrived and found the assailant standing over the victim officer’s body beating the mortally wounded officer in the face with the police badge he had taken from the officer’s shirt. The 43-year-old man, who had a prior criminal record and a history of mental disorders, was taken into custody and charged with First-Degree Murder.",1019
"A 34-year-old off-duty police officer with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department was shot and killed in an unprovoked ambush at 2:35 a.m. on April 24. When three patrons in a nightclub became disruptive and argumentative, club security escorted them out to the parking lot across the street. One of the patrons became further aggressive toward one of the bouncers, who pepper sprayed the man in defense. In an adjacent lot, a police officer working a second job as security at a restaurant observed the aggressive patron throw a punch at the bouncer, so he called 911 and requested assistance. The other club security staff in the lot intervened to separate the bouncer and the patron. Then one of the patrons fired several shots in the air from a 9 mm revolver and apparently reached down to the ground. When shots were fired, the bouncer ran back into the club to retrieve a weapon. At this time, another patron from the nightclub, who had not been involved in the argument in the parking lot and was later determined to be the off-duty police officer, attempted to confront the armed suspect and ordered him to drop the gun. However, the suspect refused to drop his gun, and he and the off-duty officer, who had nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, exchanged gunfire. The off-duty officer fired at the shooter, who fell to the ground near the back of a pickup truck. After the first shooter fell, the bouncer came out of the nightclub, approached the parking lot, and fired several rounds from a 9 mm revolver at the off-duty officer whom he believed was the initial shooter. The off-duty officer then fell to the ground. The officer in the adjacent lot informed dispatch of the shooting, went to the nightclub’s lot, and began securing the scene. The victim officer was lying between two vehicles bleeding from an unknown location with his firearm near his side. Emergency personnel transported him to a local hospital, where he was treated for a fatal gunshot wound to his neck and one to his left arm; he died shortly thereafter. The 30-year-old male, who had a prior criminal record and had been justifiably shot by the victim officer, died at the scene. The 30-year-old bouncer, who had a non-law enforcement relationship with the victim officer, was arrested and charged with Second-Degree Murder.",1087
"A 61-year-old corporal with the Somerset County Sheriff’s Office was killed while attempting to make an arrest in Norridgewock at 1:42 a.m. on April 25. The corporal, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 14 years of experience, had probable cause to arrest the suspect for trafficking cocaine based on a previous encounter. The suspect was known to law enforcement as being a user, dealer, and possessor of a controlled substance. The corporal located the suspect, who was on conditional release pending criminal prosecution, at a known previous address. While the corporal was attempting to arrest him, the suspect pulled out a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired one round at close range, striking the victim corporal’s neck/throat above his body armor, fatally wounding him. On April 28, law enforcement officers located and arrested the 29-year-old suspect at a remote hunting cabin he had broken into. He was charged with Intentional Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer. His criminal history included previous incarceration and arrests for a weapons violation and a drug law violation.",57
"A 26-year-old deputy sheriff with the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office was shot at 12 p.m. on September 28 in an ambush in Wichita. The deputy, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, had been dispatched a few minutes earlier to investigate a report of larceny. At 12:01 p.m., he radioed dispatch to report that he had been shot. Apparently, the deputy arrived at the residence but was unable to get anyone to answer the front door. He asked the dispatcher to contact the complainant on the telephone, which the dispatcher did. The complainant instructed the deputy via the dispatcher to meet him behind the residence. The deputy went to the rear of the residence, and the man, who was hiding behind a tree, immediately opened fire with a .30-30 lever-action rifle, wounding the deputy in his chest, the front below his waist, and fatally in his back, where at least one of the bullets penetrated his body armor. The force of the shot knocked the victim deputy to the ground. The man approached the deputy and attempted to shoot him at close range, but the rifle malfunctioned and did not fire. After a struggle, the man took the deputy’s service weapon, a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and pointed it at the deputy. The deputy, still lying on the ground, lifted his leg in an effort to protect himself from the bullet when the man fired the weapon, and the bullet went through the deputy’s foot and lodged in his bulletproof vest. The man fled the scene, and it was then that the victim deputy radioed dispatch that he had been shot twice. Assisting deputies arrived, secured the scene, and administered emergency medical treatment to the victim deputy until an ambulance arrived. The victim deputy was transported to a local medical center where he underwent surgery, but he succumbed to his wounds later that day. In the meantime, officers from the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office, the Wichita Police Department, the Derby Police Department, the Kansas Highway Patrol (KHP), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the FBI responded to the scene of the shooting. They surrounded the house where they believed the shooter was located and attempted negotiations with him, but those attempts were unsuccessful. Eventually they introduced gas into the house and then used a robot with a camera in an effort to find the man. However, the suspect had escaped into a rural area surrounding the house. As two ATF agents and one KHP trooper drove through the field where they believed the suspect was hiding, he fired at them with the service weapon he had taken from the fallen deputy. A brief gun battle ensued, and the suspect was fatally wounded and died at the scene. Investigating officers discovered that the man had remarked earlier that he was going to “kill a cop,” and that he subsequently had called in the false report of larceny. They found a large supply of ammunition for the .30-30 rifle and outdoor clothing in a duffle bag at the scene in addition to the victim deputy’s service weapon. The offender was a 27-year-old man with a prior criminal record that included police assault and violent crime.",230

"On August 30, just before noon, a 52-year-old deputy sheriff with the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD) was shot and killed in Sacramento after responding to a call for backup. Three officers with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) were also injured during the incident. Earlier that day, a multijurisdictional, multiagency task force was conducting surveillance on a stolen vehicle in the parking lot of a hotel. As they watched, two individuals entered the vehicle. When task force members attempted a traffic stop, the driver led them on a lengthy pursuit that ended with both individuals being taken into custody. The driver of the vehicle was on searchable probation, so investigators returned to the hotel to conduct a probation search of the room registered to the suspect. Detectives positioned themselves near the entrance and back balcony of the hotel room. As five of the investigators began to push open the door, they were fired upon from inside the room, injuring two of the officers. The investigators took cover and called for backup. The offender fled through the back door of the hotel room from the second story balcony. The SCSD deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with 21 years of experience, responded to the call and arrived during a gun battle between the suspect and the officers in the hotel parking lot. The deputy retrieved his rifle from the rack in his patrol vehicle, took cover behind his vehicle, and attempted to prevent the suspect from fleeing but was struck by a round the suspect fired from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. The round entered above the deputy’s body armor and into his front upper torso/chest, ultimately causing his death. The suspect, who was also armed with three handguns and a grenade, fled the scene in a stolen vehicle with officers in pursuit. The suspect was temporarily forced to a stop by heavy traffic at an intersection. During the stop, the suspect was shot by a pursuing officer. The suspect again fled but lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a pole. Officers took the 32-year-old suspect into custody, and he later died from his wounds. During the incident, three veteran CHP officers were injured: a 43-year-old with 17 years of law enforcement experience, a 42-year-0ld with 11 years of experience, and a 44-year-old with 11 years of experience.

A subsequent search of the hotel room yielded another handgun and a quantity of methamphetamine. At the time of the incident, the suspect was under the influence of amphetamines/methamphetamines. The suspect had an extensive criminal history including arrests for a violent crime, assault on a law enforcement officer, a weapons violation, and a drug law violation.",129
"A senior police officer with the Anniston Police Department was shot during a premeditated ambush while pursuing a suspicious person shortly before 11 a.m. on August 24. When the 27-year-old officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, approached a suspicious individual in an alley, the individual fled. The officer, who was wearing body armor, pursued the man on foot and yelled for an assisting officer to get the police vehicle. The individual ran around a corner of a residence and waited for the officer. As the officer rounded the corner, the individual fired a single round from a .22- caliber semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer in the front of the head.

The agent, who was a veteran with 6 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner directed the man to stop, but he turned into an alley and collided with a vehicle that was parked and experiencing mechanical issues. The officers ordered the man to exit his vehicle, but he rammed their patrol unit. He then got out and began firing shots from his .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, striking the agent 12 times from close range. The agent was wearing body armor, but one of the rounds entered the side of the agent’s head. When the owner of the malfunctioning vehicle saw the confrontation, he pulled out his own weapon and fired a round into the offender’s leg. Unfortunately, during the incident, a man who was helping repair the parked vehicle also sustained a gunshot wound in one leg. Two backup officers arrested the offender, who was under the influence of marijuana and on parole. The victim agent died from his head wound on April 19.

"A 25-year-old recruit officer with the Amarillo Police Department was shot and injured while answering a call for service on August 31. At 3:44 a.m., the recruit, who had 3 months of law enforcement experience, and a senior officer were dispatched to investigate a glass break alarm at a local business. As the officers neared the scene, they noticed a subject on the street waving his hand to attract their attention, so they pulled over and got out of the patrol unit to speak with him. The subject said he walked by the business, heard the alarm, and saw two people riding away on bicycles. The subject stated he had recently been released from prison and did not want to get into trouble. The officers observed the subject acting suspiciously; he was unsteady on his feet and kept repeating himself. The officers checked the contents of the subject’s backpack. Then, as the subject sat on the curb, the senior officer got into the patrol unit to run a computer check. The computer returned a parole warrant for the subject’s arrest, so the senior officer exited the patrol unit and informed the subject he was under arrest. The subject immediately ran. The officer deployed his electronic control weapon, which was ineffective. The subject ran into the side yard of a residence and was blocked by a wooden fence, so he stopped and turned toward the officers. The subject produced a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired four rounds at the officers while walking toward them. The officers returned fire, striking the subject and causing him to fall to the ground. The recruit, who was wearing body armor, was struck by one round in the front of his legs/feet. The officers could not see the subject’s hands or the firearm he had used, so the senior officer held the fallen subject at gunpoint while he radioed dispatch to report the updated situation. A backup officer covered the senior officer as he handcuffed the subject. Officers found the firearm in the grass near where the subject had been shot. Medical personnel arrived and treated both the recruit and the subject at the scene, then transported them to the hospital. The recruit underwent surgery to remove a round from his foot. At the time of the incident, the subject was under the influence of heroin and amphetamines/methamphetamines. On September 7, the 24-year-old subject was released from the hospital and immediately arrested and charged with First-Degree Attempted Capital Murder. Known to the police department as a user of a controlled substance and for theft, he had previous arrests including a drug law violation, a violent crime, and resisting arrest.

The officer, a veteran with nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a vehicle because the driver was not using headlights. Unknown to the officer, the driver had stolen the vehicle less than an hour earlier. The driver was wanted for escaping from a tether program and had multiple felony warrants for earlier motor vehicle and handgun thefts. Footage from the officer’s in-car dash camera showed the officer exited his patrol vehicle and approached the vehicle on the driver’s side.

"On a warm night around 10 o'clock in the Midwest, an officer, who had 15 years of experience, was dispatched to a domestic dispute involving a 33-year-old man and his mother, with whom he lived. That night, the man had  become angry and had fired rounds into the floor of the residence. Due to the nature of the call, backup units also responded.  The officer arrived in the area and attempted to locate the residence when he encountered a vehicle sitting in the middle of the road. The driver of the vehicle informed the officer that a female covered in blood had crossed the road and ran into the darkness. The officer was still speaking with the driver when he saw a man standing approximately 40 to 50 yards away at the rear corner of a residence. The man disappeared around the corner of the house. When the officer began questioning the driver again, the man reappeared at the same corner of the residence armed with a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The officer drew his .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and ordered the man to drop the weapon. The man fired a round at the officer, who then ordered the driver to   leave the area to avoid being shot. The officer took cover behind his patrol vehicle as the offender continued to shoot at him. The officer, realizing he could not access his shotgun or rifle without being in harm's way, decided to drive away from the line of fire and wait for the backup units to arrive.

The sergeant, a law enforcement veteran with nearly 18 years of experience, was on routine patrol when a citizen flagged her down outside a retail store. The citizen told the sergeant that a fugitive who was wanted for homicide was inside the store. The sergeant called for assistance and walked toward the store’s entrance. As she neared the doors, the suspect exited the store pushing a shopping cart. The suspect immediately began to run; the sergeant followed and reported the foot pursuit on her radio. The fugitive ran approximately 15 feet, circled a pillar while drawing his .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, and turned toward the sergeant, who had her service weapon in her hand.

"Two police agents with the Lakewood Police Department (Lakewood PD) survived injuries sustained on July 5 during a premeditated ambush. Around 9:40 p.m., Lakewood PD dispatch received two 911 calls from a female who reported she was in the process of separating from her husband, who was making suicidal comments. The caller stated her husband possessed several firearms, and he told her if she called the police, there would “be a battle.” She also reported that her husband sent a text message to her son threatening to kill him. Shortly before 10 p.m., a male caller contacted 911, identified himself by first name, and provided the same address as the female caller. The caller advised there was a “guy out front with a gun ready to kill a bunch of people.” When dispatch asked the man for his exact location, he said, “I’m the guy with the gun.” The caller told dispatchers that he had three guns, and he was outside his home in the back of his pickup truck. Police agents were dispatched to the scene; the first to arrive approached the residence from the west. The 32-year-old veteran agent, who had more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, turned off his patrol vehicle’s headlights and prepared to stop approximately four houses west of the man’s residence. However, before his vehicle came to a stop, the suspect fired his 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle and struck the agent, who was wearing body armor, in the front upper torso/chest and the arms/hands. The agent exited his patrol vehicle while it was still moving. The vehicle continued traveling east, unmanned, until it struck a truck in the suspect’s driveway and came to rest in the suspect’s front lawn. The agent radioed for assistance and applied a tourniquet to his wounded arm. Other agents arrived and assisted in moving the injured agent to a safer location west of the scene. From there, he was transported to a local hospital. Shortly after the first agent was shot, a second agent parked her patrol vehicle east of the suspect’s residence and attempted to approach on foot. The suspect fired another round from the same weapon and struck the 28-year-old agent, who was wearing body armor, in the front below the waist (leg). The agent, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, collapsed onto the sidewalk. Other agents arrived and assisted her to a safer location. She was also transported to a local hospital. After shooting the agents, the suspect exited his truck and walked out into the street. He called 911 again, apologized to dispatch, and said, “I hit that cop, and now it’s too far.” The suspect explained to dispatch that he was walking in the middle of the road, and he “has to die now.” Dispatch advised the suspect to speak to the agents. The suspect responded, “I just shot one. They’re going to have to kill me.” The suspect ended the call by providing his exact location, informing dispatch that he was far away from the scene, and instructing the dispatcher to get help for the wounded agents. Another agent heard about the incident on the radio and responded to the scene. He parked his patrol vehicle nearby and took cover behind a fire truck. When the fire truck moved, the agent saw the suspect walking in the middle of the street and carrying a .44-caliber revolver. The agent ordered the suspect to drop his weapon multiple times, but the suspect did not comply. Instead, the suspect raised his revolver and pointed it at the agent. The agent fired several rounds with his service weapon, striking the suspect once in the chest. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to a local hospital. The 54-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record with a conviction, was charged with two counts each of Attempted First-Degree Murder and First-Degree Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer as well as Felony Menacing.

"Approximately 3 o'clock on a winter afternoon in the South, an officer, who had 6 years of law enforcement experience, accompanied the owner of a mobile home to serve a dispossessory warrant for non-payment of rent. The 55-year-old tenant answered the door and quickly shut it upon learning of the warrant. The officer pursued the tenant inside the residence; however, the tenant exited through the back door and ran toward a wooded area behind the residence. Unbeknownst to the officer, the tenant had dug a foxhole in the woods and stored firearms and ammunition inside. With the officer in pursuit, the man produced a firearm and they exchanged gunfire; one round grazed the offender's clothes. After reaching the foxhole, the offender used a .30-.30-caliber rifle to shoot and kill the officer. A nearby officer, who had 9 years of experience, was alerted to the incident and responded to   assist. Upon her arrival, the assisting officer learned that the downed officer was located in an overgrown field just before the wooded area. The assisting officer crawled to the downed officer to check his status. Meanwhile, another backup officer responded and positioned himself near the residence. However, the offender also shot and killed him with a .30-.30-caliber rifle. Once she determined the downed officer had been killed, the assisting  officer crawled back to the residence and found the backup officer had also been killed. The assisting officer waited for specialized forces, ground support, and air support to arrive. Officers eventually located the offender, who surrendered without further incident. The offender was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.",1224
"A 30-year-old patrol officer with the New Hartford Police Department was shot and killed at 8:20 p.m. on February 27 while pursuing suspects in a robbery at a local jewelry store. At 8:17 p.m., the Oneida County 911 Center received a silent alarm from the jewelry store and dispatched officers to the scene. At least two individuals, and possibly as many as four individuals, had entered the store brandishing weapons and had handcuffed the store’s employees. The robbers disabled the store’s video surveillance system and stole watches, loose diamonds, and diamond rings. Though police units arrived at the scene within minutes, the robbers fled from the store, and a high speed car chase ensued. The chase ended in Kirkland where the driver of the getaway car attempted to turn into a parking lot of a market, but crashed the car into gasoline pumps in front of the store. When two men exited the vehicle, officers subdued one of them. However, the other man fled toward a wooded area at the edge of the parking lot. When the man entered the tree line, he turned and fired one shot with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the pursuing officer, fatally striking him in the upper chest. The victim officer, who had 6 years of law enforcement experience, was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Canine units dispatched to find the shooting suspect led police to a business in Kirkland where the suspect had carjacked a tow truck. The suspect forced the tow truck driver at gunpoint to drive him to Pennsylvania, gave the tow truck driver $100, and released him. The next day, the U.S. Marshals Service obtained a warrant for the shooting suspect citing the charge of Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution. Law enforcement personnel tracked the 36-year-old man to a house in Chester, Pennsylvania. When a U.S. Marshals Service Task Force tried to enter the house, the suspect exited the front door and fired at the entry team with a handgun. The entry team returned fire and killed the offender, who had a prior criminal record that included convictions for murder, drugs, and weapons violations. The offender, along with the other individuals involved in the jewelry heist in New Hartford, were thought to have been involved in other jewelry robberies in the Northeast.",276

"On the morning of March 2, a 50-year-old sergeant with the Fugitive Apprehension Squad of the Glendale Police Department (GPD) was shot and critically wounded while performing undercover surveillance on a subject wanted on two felony warrants. A team of officers from the GPD and a U.S. Marshals’ task force worked together to apprehend the subject. Using GPS coordinates from the subject’s cell phone, task force members located him at a storage facility. The officers then observed the subject running away from the facility towards a strip mall. At 8:18 a.m., the sergeant confronted the subject, who immediately pulled out a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired two rounds at the sergeant, wounding him in the front upper torso/chest with one round. An assisting officer fired three rounds at the offender but missed. The offender fled into the front door of a nearby business and exited out the back door, where another officer fired at him.

"A police officer and a corporal from the Baton Rouge Police Department (BRPD) and a deputy sheriff with the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office (EBRPSO) were killed on July 17 in Baton Rouge during an ambush (entrapment and premeditation). A sergeant and a corporal, both with the EBRPSO, and an officer with the BRPD were also injured. Approximately 8:40 a.m., the BRPD received a call about an individual carrying a rifle near a shopping plaza. (Louisiana had a gun law allowing open carry at the time.) Authorities planned to question the individual, but had no known cause to take him into custody. Minutes after the call, a 41-year-old police officer and a 32-year-old corporal from the BRPD, and a 45-year-old deputy with the EBRPSO arrived near the shopping plaza behind a building next to a gas station. The individual spotted them from at least 50 feet away and began shooting at them with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The BRPD corporal, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 10 years’ experience, was struck in the front of the head and in the front upper torso/chest. The rounds exceeded the specifications of the body armor the victim corporal was wearing, penetrating the vest and killing him instantly. Rounds also struck the BRPD officer, who had 9 months of law enforcement experience. The rounds also exceeded his body armor’s specifications, penetrating his vest and wounding him. The injured officer was able to crawl behind the building. The EBRPSO deputy, who was a veteran with more than 24 years of experience in law enforcement, ran to the victim officer’s aid. The assailant then stepped from around the corner of the back of the building and shot the EBRPSO deputy, wounding him. The victim deputy fell to the ground, but was able to fire 13 rounds from his .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. None struck the assailant, who then killed the deputy. The victim deputy had wounds to the front, rear, and side of his head; neck/throat; front upper torso/chest; rear upper torso/back; front below his waist; and rear below his waist. The victim deputy was wearing body armor, but rounds entered above his vest. The injured BRPD officer moved a bit, and the assailant shot him twice more, killing him. His wounds were in the side of his head and in his front upper torso/chest. By this point, a second BRPD officer arrived and had pulled up in front of the building. The assailant shot and wounded him; however, details of his injuries were not known at the time of this report. The suspect then retreated toward his vehicle, using businesses and nearby woods for cover. He opened fire on a 41-year-old corporal with the EBRPSO, a veteran with nearly 18 years of law enforcement experience, who had just returned to his patrol unit to run the license plate of the suspect’s vehicle. The corporal was struck and wounded in his arms/hands, in the side of his head, and in the front lower torso/stomach. He was wearing body armor, but a round entered below the vest. The suspect then shot at a 57-year-old EBRPSO sergeant, who was also wearing body armor and was a 23-year veteran of law enforcement, wounding him in the arms/hands. Officers from the BRPD SWAT team arrived. Using the patrol vehicles as cover, a member of the SWAT team fired from approximately 100 yards away and killed the 29-year-old suspect. The suspect had a prior criminal record. A subsequent investigation revealed that the suspect intended to attack the BRPD headquarters, which was nearby, and continue to kill officers.

"On July 7 at 11:15 p.m., a 28-year-old deputy sheriff with the Hall County Sheriff’s Office (HCSO) was shot and killed in Gainesville as he performed a high-risk traffic stop and foot pursuit. The deadly incident began with a car chase involving four suspects who were under investigation for recent burglaries and were under surveillance for motor vehicle theft. Earlier, HCSO deputies had identified several stolen vehicles and placed GPS locators on them. The 28-year-old deputy, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, took over surveillance of the vehicles at shift change. At some point, the suspects departed in one of the stolen vehicles. The deputy pursued them, making a traffic stop. The suspects fled in the stolen vehicle from the traffic stop, crashed the vehicle, and HCSO deputies, who had joined the chase, pursued the four suspects as they attempted to escape on foot. Body camera footage showed deputies and the suspects exchanged gunfire during the pursuit. One suspect fired a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the 28-year-old deputy, fatally wounding him in the front lower torso/abdomen below his body armor.

"On November 4, a 55-year-old detective with the Dayton Police Department was killed while serving a narcotics-related federal search warrant as part of a Drug Enforcement Administration task force. Shortly before 7 p.m., a group of law enforcement officers knocked at the door of a residence, announced their presence, then forced open a side door and entered. The detective, a law enforcement veteran with 30 years of experience, headed down the stairs toward the basement in search of suspects. A subject hiding in the basement fired on the detective with a 5.7x28 mm semiautomatic handgun. Although the detective was wearing body armor, two rounds struck him in the front of his head, mortally wounding him. Assisting officers disabled the suspect with chemical/pepper spray and an electronic control weapon. The wounded detective was transported to the hospital in a patrol unit.

"Around 6:30 a.m., three members of a fugitive task force, including the 45-year-old deputy marshal, went to a residence seeking a fugitive, who was previously charged with Aggravated Battery and was wanted for Failure to Appear. The officers knocked repeatedly until the fugitive’s wife finally answered the door. Although she initially denied that her husband was home, she eventually agreed to let the officers in and reported that her husband was hiding in the attic and she was not certain if he was armed. Requested backup officers arrived, a perimeter was set around the house, and the 39-year-old K- 9 officer and his dog searched the house but did not find the fugitive. Officers then decided to search the attic and found a covered opening in the hall ceiling. A detective pushed off the cover, banged on the ceiling, and commanded the fugitive to give up and come down. There was no response. After the deputy marshal scanned the attic with a lighted telescoping mirror, the K-9 officer used a step ladder to enter the attic and the deputy marshal followed. Each of them had their gun in hand. To help see, the K- 9 officer set his flashlight on the attic floor and used the light on his gun. The deputy marshal used a light from his electronic control device (ECD). After more unanswered commands for the fugitive to show himself, the deputy marshal climbed down from the attic. Officers then heard the K-9 officer command the fugitive to show his hands. The deputy marshal climbed back up and saw the K-9 officer pointing his gun at the fugitive who was lying in the rafters, arms out, face down, with his feet closest to the officers, about 10-15 feet from the attic entrance. The deputy marshal also aimed his service weapon at the fugitive, who began backing up on his elbows and knees towards the officers. The deputy marshal transitioned to his ECD, the light of which illuminated the fugitive, who told the officers that they had him as he continued crawling backwards. As the K-9 officer removed handcuffs from his duty belt and bent over, the fugitive turned over. The K-9 officer commanded him to stop and the deputy marshal fired and activated his ECD into the fugitive’s shoulder and chest. The deputy marshal heard the men struggle and activated the ECD again as the fugitive yelled. Following a muffled gunshot, the deputy marshal activated the ECD a third time. The fugitive then fired three to four rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun; one round hit the K-9 officer in his face, fatally wounding him. As the deputy marshal transitioned back to his service weapon, the fugitive shot him twice, striking him in the front of his ballistic vest and below the waist. The deputy marshal fell through the attic entrance onto the detective on the ladder and then fell to the floor. As the fugitive began firing through the attic floor at the officers below, a patrol officer pulled the injured deputy marshal into a nearby bathroom to take cover. The other officers retreated from the house. More officers arrived, including the 48-year-old sergeant from the SPPD. Around 7:43 a.m., the sergeant and other officers entered the residence and moved towards the attic opening where the fallen K-9 officer’s foot was visible. The officers used semiautomatic rifles to cover the sergeant, who held a ballistic shield as he moved under the attic entrance toward the officers still in the bathroom. As the sergeant passed under the attic entrance, the fugitive shot him with the K-9 officer’s service weapon. The round hit the sergeant in the back but was deflected by his body armor. The fugitive fired two more rounds—one glanced the sergeant’s ballistic shield and the other struck the sergeant’s chest, above his protective vest, and traveled through his torso. The other officers fired into the attic, and the sergeant crawled from the hallway into a bedroom. Another officer got on the ladder and pulled on the K-9 officer’s foot but was unable to move him. The fugitive began firing at the officer, who fell off the ladder then took cover in the bathroom. There, the officer broke out the window and assisted the patrol officer in helping the injured deputy marshal outside. The officer then broke the bedroom window from the exterior and entered the bedroom where the injured sergeant was lying. When the fugitive began shooting in that direction, the officer blocked the door with a cabinet, preventing a clear shot into the bedroom. Officers removed the victim sergeant through the bedroom window. He was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead from the chest wound received from the suspect’s 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. After more than an hour of failed telephone negotiations with the fugitive, the SPPD’s Tactical Apprehension and Control (TAC) Team fired tear gas canisters into the attic and entered the house. Again, the fugitive began shooting through the attic floor. The officers returned fire, retreated, and discharged more tear gas into the attic. The TAC Team then entered a second time, and shot into the ceiling where they had heard movement in the attic, but away from the K-9 officer. During the cover fire, TAC Team members freed the K-9 officer, whose leg had been wrapped in wire and ductwork, and carried him outside. The victim K-9 officer, who was attended by a physician at the scene, was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. Around 11 a.m., heavy equipment was used to remove portions of the house and a robot was used to inspect the attic. The fugitive’s dead body was found with his handgun and the K-9 officer’s service weapon close by. Evidence indicated that the fugitive was justifiably killed by law enforcement. The 39-year-old shooter had a criminal history that included violent crime, police assault, and weapons violations. He was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. ",643

At the time this summary was written, at least three of the injured detectives had not returned to duty.",776
"At 6:20 p.m. on May 4, a 45-year-old patrol officer with the Terre Haute Police Department (THPD) was shot and killed while investigating a homicide that occurred earlier in the day. An off-duty officer located the homicide suspect at a gas station, radioed for assistance, and followed the suspect and a female companion to a nearby apartment complex. A number of THPD officers, including the patrol officer, joined the off-duty officer at the apartment complex and confronted the suspect as he entered the female’s apartment. The officers ordered the suspect to get on the ground, but the suspect failed to comply. Instead, the suspect produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired at the officers. The patrol officer, who was wearing body armor, returned gunfire with one round from his service weapon. The officers and the suspect continued to exchange gunfire. None of the officers’ rounds struck the suspect; however, one of the suspect’s rounds fatally struck the veteran patrol officer, who had 22 years of law enforcement experience, in the front of the head. The officers quickly moved the victim officer away from the scene and transported him to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced deceased. Meanwhile, officers surrounded the complex and used drones with cameras in an attempt to locate the suspect. SWAT officers arrived and used nonlethal bullets to break windows to aid in the search. The suspect’s female companion called the officers from inside her apartment. She stated that the suspect was lying motionless on the floor in her doorway, bleeding from the head. Officers instructed the female to retrieve the suspect’s weapon, place it in a plastic bag, and exit the complex with her hands in the air. She complied, and officers transported her away from the scene. She was taken into custody and charged with Obstruction of Justice for her role in the homicide earlier in the day.

"A 56-year-old sergeant with the Bismarck Police Department was shot and killed while investigating a domestic disturbance call on July 8. When the sergeant, a nearly 36-year veteran of law enforcement, and other officers arrived on the scene around 10:40 p.m., the suspect was no longer in the area. As the officers attempted to locate the suspect on foot, the sergeant saw him in a van that was parked on the side of the roadway. He approached the van while giving verbal commands for the suspect to show his hands. When the sergeant was less than 10 feet from the van, the 52-year-old suspect fired a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun through the tinted back window, fatally striking the sergeant in the front upper torso/chest. Another officer in the area had heard the sergeant giving verbal commands and had made his way to the area. He shot at least four rounds into the van and one round struck the suspect in the head, incapacitating him. The suspect, who was under the influence of alcohol, had a prior criminal record and was on probation at the time of the incident.

A 35-year-old state trooper with the same detachment, who had nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience, was injured in the same incident. Approximately 7:45 p.m., officers from the Nazareth Borough Police Department (NBPD) responded to the residence of a reported protection from abuse violation. When the officers arrived at the home, they found that the suspect had left the home with his 9-year-old son.

"At 11:10 a.m. on September 13, an officer from the Miami-Dade Police Department was killed and three other officers were wounded while investigating a suspicious circumstance. The 37-year-old officer with nearly 8 years of law enforcement experience and his partner were working undercover. While riding together in a vehicle, they noticed a vehicle being driven erratically. The officers followed the vehicle to an apartment complex and approached the driver, identifying themselves as police officers. The man fled on foot, and both officers pursued him. The two officers separated and attempted to establish a perimeter around the apartment complex. The man entered his residence and subsequently began firing a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle through the front window of the building, striking the victim officer, who fell to the ground. The suspect exited the apartment and fired at the officer six more times at close range, striking him in the stomach, in the front below his waist, and fatally in the chest.

The officer, who was wearing body armor, stopped his vehicle approximately three to four car lengths from the subject and radioed dispatch to convey what he saw. The subject walked toward the sidewalk, between parked cars. The officer exited his vehicle, drew his weapon, and took cover behind a car. He then ordered the subject to drop his weapon. The subject opened fire on the officer with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. One round went through the windshield and the back window of the car, striking the officer in the front of his head and grazing his scalp. The subject started to yell, but the officer could not understand what the subject was saying. (Witnesses later reported that the subject was yelling for the officer to shoot and kill him.) While the officer was bleeding from his wound, he stood up from behind the car and fired two shots, both striking the subject in the upper torso. The victim officer radioed dispatch to request help for his head wound and to advise that the suspect was down. The officer remained behind the cover of a car with his weapon drawn. Another officer arrived and located the injured officer who pointed in the direction where the suspect was located about 25 yards away. The assisting officer saw the man lying on his back on the sidewalk. The rifle was on the ground beside the subject, and a pistol was in his waistband. The officer ordered the suspect to roll over on his stomach, but he did not respond. Medical personnel arrived on scene and assisted the officer and the suspect. The victim officer was airlifted to an area hospital where he was treated for his injuries. The 18-year-old suspect was pronounced dead at the scene, justifiably killed by the injured officer. Officers processing the crime scene found the suspect had a total of 225 rounds of ammunition on his person. Further investigation located three suicide notes at the suspect’s residence and multiple computer searches related to mass shootings, suicide, and weapons. Toxicology reports confirmed that the suspect, who had a prior criminal record and convictions, was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. The officer who was shot has since recovered from his wound and has returned to duty.",417

"A 26-year-old officer with the Greeley Police Department (GPD) was shot and injured while attempting a high-risk traffic stop at 11:30 p.m. on November 14 in Evans. Approximately two hours earlier, a person called 911 to report that someone had shot at his vehicle as he was driving. The caller described the suspect vehicle’s color, make, and model to the dispatcher. At 10:45 p.m., a deputy from the Weld County Sheriff’s Office located the suspect’s vehicle approximately 11 miles away at a gas station. The deputy noted the vehicle’s license plate number before the driver fled in the vehicle. Nearly an hour later, the GPD officer, who had 2 ½ years of law enforcement experience, located the vehicle being driven by the suspect and began a pursuit. Sometime during the chase, the offender began shooting at the officer with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. Approximately 9 minutes after the pursuit began, the offender drove to his residence. He stopped in front of the house, exited his vehicle, and immediately fired at officers. The GPD officer, who was wearing body armor, was shot once in the arms/hands. The officer took cover behind his patrol car and returned fire but did not strike the offender. The offender ran into the house and barricaded the door. At 1:44 a.m. on November 15, the offender told SWAT officers not to enter the residence and said he was going to commit suicide. A short time later, officers heard a single gunshot and later found the 40-year-old offender deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In all, the offender shot 55 rounds at officers. The offender was under the influence of amphetamines/methamphetamines at the time of the incident. He was known to law enforcement as a violent offender with a gang affiliation. He had a criminal record that included aggravated assault, a drug law violation, and a weapons violation. The injured GPD officer has since returned to duty.",10
"A police officer and a corporal from the Baton Rouge Police Department (BRPD) and a deputy sheriff with the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office (EBRPSO) were killed on July 17 in Baton Rouge during an ambush (entrapment and premeditation). A sergeant and a corporal, both with the EBRPSO, and an officer with the BRPD were also injured. Approximately 8:40 a.m., the BRPD received a call about an individual carrying a rifle near a shopping plaza. (Louisiana had a gun law allowing open carry at the time.) Authorities planned to question the individual, but had no known cause to take him into custody. Minutes after the call, a 41-year-old police officer and a 32-year-old corporal from the BRPD, and a 45- year-old deputy with the EBRPSO arrived near the shopping plaza behind a building next to a gas station. The individual spotted them from at least 50 feet away and began shooting at them with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The BRPD corporal, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 10 years’ experience, was struck in the front of the head and in the front upper torso/chest. The rounds exceeded the specifications of the body armor the victim corporal was wearing, penetrating the vest and killing him instantly. Rounds also struck the BRPD officer, who had 9 months of law enforcement experience. The rounds also exceeded his body armor’s specifications, penetrating his vest and wounding him. The injured officer was able to crawl behind the building. The EBRPSO deputy, who was a veteran with more than 24 years of experience in law enforcement, ran to the victim officer’s aid. The assailant then stepped from around the corner of the back of the building and shot the EBRPSO deputy, wounding him. The victim deputy fell to the ground, but was able to fire 13 rounds from his .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. None struck the assailant, who then killed the deputy. The victim deputy had wounds to the front, rear, and side of his head; neck/throat; front upper torso/chest; rear upper torso/back; front below his waist; and rear below his waist. The victim deputy was wearing body armor, but rounds entered above his vest. The injured BRPD officer moved a bit, and the assailant shot him twice more, killing him. His wounds were in the side of his head and in his front upper torso/chest. By this point, a second BRPD officer arrived and had pulled up in front of the building. The assailant shot and wounded him; however, details of his injuries were not known at the time of this report. The suspect then retreated toward his vehicle, using businesses and nearby woods for cover. He opened fire on a 41-year- old corporal with the EBRPSO, a veteran with nearly 18 years of law enforcement experience, who had just returned to his patrol unit to run the license plate of the suspect’s vehicle. The corporal was struck and wounded in his arms/hands, in the side of his head, and in the front lower torso/stomach. He was wearing body armor, but a round entered below the vest. The suspect then shot at a 57-year-old EBRPSO sergeant, who was also wearing body armor and was a 23-year veteran of law enforcement, wounding him in the arms/hands. Officers from the BRPD SWAT team arrived. Using the patrol vehicles as cover, a member of the SWAT team fired from approximately 100 yards away and killed the 29-year- old suspect. The suspect had a prior criminal record. A subsequent investigation revealed that the suspect intended to attack the BRPD headquarters, which was nearby, and continue to kill officers. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, neither the injured EBRPSO corporal nor the EBRPSO sergeant had returned to duty.",540
"On August 2 about 11:45 a.m., a 46-year-old deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department was shot to death in an ambush in a remote area of the county. The veteran officer, who had just over 12 years of law enforcement experience, was patrolling a sparsely populated region near Llano. At 11:40 a.m. he radioed a request for a license plate check on a vehicle belonging to a local resident. Minutes later, dispatchers heard gunshots over the deputy’s radio and immediately sent assisting units to the scene. Apparently, as the officer approached the man’s dwelling, the man opened fire on him with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle, striking the officer in his head and neck and also in his chest and stomach area. Several rounds from the powerful rifle penetrated the deputy’s body armor; however, the officer managed to fire three rounds before succumbing to his injuries. The assailant tied the deputy’s body to the rear of his vehicle and dragged him approximately one half mile away from the scene. The man then returned to his residence where he was observed packing his vehicle with some of his personal items. Before leaving, the suspect took several items from the victim deputy’s patrol car, including the radio, a 9 mm service weapon, and a revolver. When the responding officers arrived at the scene, their investigation led them to the suspect’s abandoned vehicle approximately 2 1⁄2 miles from the dwelling where the deputy had been shot. The investigators found evidence in the vehicle linking the man to the deputy’s murder. Six days later, officers located the alleged assailant in a deserted residence 4 miles west of the shooting scene. A SWAT Team set up a perimeter around the location, and after a 10-hour standoff, the man began shooting at the deputies. During the shootout, the structure caught fire, and the suspect died in the blaze. Investigators found the 52-year-old man’s body at the scene as well as the gun used in the victim officer’s murder. The alleged assailant, who was on probation at the time of the incident, was known to be hostile toward law enforcement personnel and had been arrested previously for Battery on a Peace Officer and Assault with a Deadly Weapon.",803
"A 51-year-old officer with the Arcata Police Department was assaulted and suffered injuries to his hand while answering a call for backup on March 16. At 6:42 a.m., another officer was dispatched to a local grocery store following a report of a theft of coffee. The dispatcher provided the subject’s name and description of the vehicle, which was parked in front of the store. The officer knew the subject from previous law enforcement contacts and was aware from recent morning briefings that law enforcement had banned the subject from the store premises. Upon his arrival at the store, the officer observed the subject standing next to his vehicle. When the subject saw the officer, he got into his vehicle and locked all the doors. A store employee pointed at the subject and identified him as the man who had stolen coffee. The officer approached the subject’s vehicle and asked him to open the window; the subject rolled the window down about an inch. The officer noticed a half-full mug of steaming coffee in the passenger seat. When the officer asked why the subject had stolen the coffee, he replied, “Because I can.” The subject admitted he had been asked to leave the property earlier the same morning. When the officer informed the subject he was trespassing, he replied with phrases such as “just shoot me then,” “suicide by cop,” and “pull the trigger.” The subject rolled up the window and turned up the volume of the radio. The officer asked the subject to exit the vehicle several times, but he refused. Two officers arrived to assist, and the original responding officer advised them of the situation and requested help to arrest the subject. The 51- year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, told the subject that he was under arrest and ordered him to exit his vehicle several times, but the subject did not comply. The officers observed the subject pretending to shave his beard with a knife and then actually cutting his neck. Because the subject was a danger to himself, the 51-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, broke the front passenger side window, opened the door, and entered through it. The second assisting officer got into the car through the same door and unsuccessfully attempted to unlock the driver’s side door. Meanwhile, the 51-year-old officer wrestled the subject for the knife and repeatedly ordered him to drop the weapon. The original responding officer went to the passenger side and fired his electronic control device, which struck the offender in the upper right shoulder but had little effect. The second assisting officer unlocked the driver’s side door, so the original responding officer went back to that side of the vehicle, removed the subject from the car, and placed him in handcuffs. The subject had three 2- inch cuts on his left hand and abrasions on the right side of his neck, so the officers requested medical transport for him. During the struggle, the 51-year-old officer suffered a 1-inch cut on his left thumb. He was transported to a local hospital where he received six stitches and was released. The injured officer has since returned to duty. The 45-year- old offender was charged with Trespassing, Shoplifting, Obstruct/Resist Executive Officer, and Resisting Arrest. He had a criminal history that resulted in him being incarcerated in a penal institution.",1108
"A 51-year-old officer with the U.S. Forest Service in Vancouver was shot and killed while investigating a suspicious person near Sequim around 2:45 p.m. on September 20. The 21-year veteran of law enforcement was responding to a report of a suspicious man and a van without a license plate at a campground in Olympic National Forest. She notified Washington State Patrol dispatch that she was going to be out of her vehicle talking with a man she believed was associated with the van. She requested a driver’s check, and gave the name and date of birth that the man provided. The dispatcher advised the officer that the man was a convicted felon, had a temporary protection order and a no contact order placed against him, and that he was on parole. The officer acknowledged receipt of the message. The dispatcher attempted to contact the officer for an updated status but did not receive a response. Clallam County deputies and Washington State Patrol troopers responded to the area and found the victim officer lying in the woods at the side of the road below her marked patrol vehicle, which was still running with the emergency lights activated and her K-9 partner in the vehicle. The officer, who was wearing body armor, died of a gunshot wound to the side of the head from a handgun. Officers searched the area and found the suspect’s van abandoned several miles from the scene. Fliers of the suspect were posted around the community. Around 9 p.m. that evening, Clallam County deputies responded to a 911 call from employees at a local establishment who thought the suspect was inside their store. As two deputies arrived, the suspect was coming out of the front of the building. They ordered the man to stop, but he continued walking forward, reached to his waist, and pulled out a pistol. The deputies shot and killed the 36-year-old suspect. Further investigation revealed that the suspect had also killed a second victim, a recently retired correctional officer who was shot to death and whose vehicle was found at the store where deputies had killed the suspect.",464
"A 36-year-old patrol officer with the Richmond Police Department was shot in the arms/hands while responding to a disturbance call shortly before 5:30 p.m. on August 5. The officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 8 ½ years of experience, was dispatched with other officers to a report of an individual flashing a firearm. The officers turned into a nearby alley where they saw a person matching the description of the individual with the firearm. Upon exiting the vehicle, one of the officers asked the individual his name, and he replied. The officer also saw a handgun in the right side of the individual’s waistband. When the officer asked the individual to come over, the individual asked if he was under arrest. The officer said no, and the individual began running down the alley. Officers pursued; the first officer, who had spoken to the individual, veered around a parked car. The second officer stayed behind the individual, who fell on some gravel. The officer, not anticipating the individual’s fall, ran past him a slight distance before stopping. The officer, who was wearing body armor, turned to face the individual and reached for his conductive energy device. At the same time, the individual rose, produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and fired a single shot at the officer at close range, striking him in the arms/hands (left arm). The victim officer, who was known to the suspect through a prior law enforcement relationship, fell to the ground, and the suspect began to run down the alley in the direction they had just come from. As the suspect ran, he continued to fire at the officers. The victim officer, despite his wound, was able to get on his knees and fire a shot at the suspect with his service weapon, but missed. The victim officer then held his fire to avoid hitting the pursuing officer. The pursuing officer continued to chase the suspect, who had turned as he ran away and shot at both officers. The pursuing officer fired back at the suspect with his handgun until the suspect made a turn around a wooden fence and shed. When the officer regained sight of the suspect, he was on the ground near a fence; the suspect did not respond to the officer’s commands. When other officers arrived, they placed the suspect in handcuffs and called for an ambulance. The 20-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to use and deal drugs, had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime and a weapons violation. He was justifiably killed by the pursuing officer during their exchange of gunfire. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital in a police vehicle. He has since returned to duty.",343
"On March 11, a 34-year-old trooper first class with the Maryland State Police was stabbed while answering a call for service involving the malicious destruction of property. Around 7 a.m., the trooper, a veteran of law enforcement with 5 years of experience, was dispatched to an address in Westminster. He had been called to the same address the previous day, also regarding the malicious destruction of property. The trooper arrived at the scene at 7:14 a.m. and began speaking with the complainant. At 7:50 a.m., the dispatcher received another report that a suspect in the same area was using a knife to slash tires on a vehicle. Already at the scene, the trooper encountered a subject armed with a knife with a 4.5-inch blade. According to witnesses, the trooper ordered the subject at least five times to drop the knife and attempted to de-escalate the situation for more than 3 minutes. The witnesses said the offender advanced toward the trooper and brandished the knife “like a ninja.” During the ensuing altercation, the trooper was stabbed once on the right side between the side panels of his body armor, sustaining injuries to his front upper torso/chest and rear upper torso/back. The trooper drew his service weapon and fired two rounds, striking the offender with both. The trooper and a witness who was a nurse rendered aid to the offender.

The two robbers apparently spotted the captain riding alone, exited their vehicle, and approached him carrying a rifle. The 53-year-old officer saw the weapon and immediately drew his service pistol and official identification from his fanny pack. He attempted to take cover behind a nearby traffic signal control box, but before the captain could reach cover, one of the men began shooting with the 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle and wounded him.

"Around 2:45 on a dark autumn morning in the West, law enforcement officers were dispatched to an area near a casino and RV park where shots had been fired. When the first officers arrived, a subject shot at them from his RV. Backup was coordinated, and an officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, entered the park from the rear to avoid potential crossfire. At that time, the officer believed the offender was still inside his RV.  The RV park was circular and surrounded by a dirt mound approximately 15 feet tall. Moonlight provided the only light, so visibility was poor. The officer was making his way across the mound when he heard a noise that was quickly followed by muzzle flashes and gunshots. The officer received three gunshot wounds: one round hit his stomach but was stopped by his protective vest, the second round hit his rib cage area entering between the  vest's panels and exiting the officer's back, and the third round struck him in the back. The wounded officer lost his balance and fell down the hill but was able to get back up and shoot at the offender. The officer began working his way back to his patrol vehicle and came upon another officer in a patrol vehicle. The assisting officer transported the wounded officer away from the area and sought medical treatment.  Shortly thereafter, three officers surrounded the offender. The officers and the offender exchanged gunfire until a round struck the offender in his leg and he surrendered. The 46-year-old military combat veteran was convicted and sentenced to several years in prison. The injured officer later recovered from his wounds and returned to full duty.",1238

The officers asked to speak with him, and the suspect allowed the officers to come inside while he finished dressing. The three men then went back outside, and the suspect sat on the porch steps while officers questioned him about the incidents that had occurred days earlier. After a discussion, the suspect eventually admitted to taking a car without the owner’s consent, eluding police, and later hitting a telephone pole. He told officers he fled from police because he didn’t have a driver’s license, was currently on probation, and had been drinking alcohol. At that point, the suspect asked police if he could go inside the residence to get a drink. The victim officer later stated because of the suspect’s cooperativeness, the officers agreed and followed the suspect inside where he got a glass of water. The three men again returned to the porch area, and the suspect sat on the porch steps. The suspect talked to the officers for another 10-15 minutes about the previous incidents. The suspect requested more water, and the officers refused the request. The officers told the suspect that he was under arrest. Both officers reached for the man to handcuff him. The officer’s partner ordered the man to put his hands behind his back. The officer grabbed the suspect by his wrist/forearm, and immediately the man began to pull away. The suspect jumped off the steps, onto the ground, and struck the officer in the right side of his face with the drinking glass, shattering it and cutting the victim officer’s face and neck; then he attempted to run away. Both officers regained hold of the suspect, and the victim officer radioed dispatch for assistance as a violent struggle ensued that brought all three men to the ground. The officers were ordering the suspect to stop resisting when the suspect began to grab the victim officer’s duty belt in an apparent attempt to take the officer’s service weapon. The officer covered his weapon with both of his hands to prevent the suspect from taking it while alerting his partner of the suspect’s actions. The victim officer shouted for his partner to use the electronic control device (ECD) to subdue the suspect. While the officer’s partner was restraining the suspect, the victim officer managed to remove his ECD from his duty belt and deploy it into the suspect’s side on his bare skin. The suspect continued to fight the officers and attempted to dislodge the ECD’s wires. The victim officer repositioned the ECD onto the suspect’s calf and administered a stun, but it had no effect. The officer discarded the ECD and positioned himself on top of the suspect, who was lying face down on the ground. To create a distraction and attempt to stop the man from resisting, the officer struck the suspect in the face and used his forearm on the back of the suspect’s neck to pin him down. More officers arrived at the scene and assisted in getting the suspect handcuffed while the victim officer attended to his wounds. The suspect continued to resist after he was handcuffed and unsuccessfully attempted to bite the partner officer’s hand. The victim officer sustained significant wounds to the side of his head, neck/throat, and arms/hands from the drinking glass. An ambulance was requested, and the officer was transported to the hospital where he received 13 facial stitches. Medical personnel attended to the 19-year-old suspect at the scene for a bloody nose. He was taken to the hospital and cleared for admission to jail. The suspect, a known drug user and possessor who was on probation at the time of the incident, had prior violent crime and drug-related charges. The suspect was charged with Battery to a Law Enforcement Officer, Resisting Arrest–Felony, Attempting to Disarm a Law Enforcement Officer, First-Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety, Knowingly Fleeing a Law Enforcement Officer, Operating a Motor Vehicle without Owner’s Consent, and Substantial Battery.",251
"On October 26 at 1:20 p.m., a 54-year-old sheriff with the Sheridan County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed by a man who had a history of mental illness. The man had come into the sheriff’s office in Hoxie voluntarily to answer questions about his father’s grave, which someone had attempted to unearth. The man insisted that he had not been responsible for digging up the grave; however, the sheriff, who had 18 years of law enforcement experience, noted that he appeared to be having trouble accepting his father’s death. The sheriff attempted to persuade him to undergo psychological evaluation and told him that the officers could take him to a place where he could receive help with his emotional state. After several minutes of dialogue, the man consented to an evaluation, and he was asked to remove his coat before officers transported him to the appropriate facility. The man appeared to comply, and the officers who were present prepared to search him for weapons; however, he pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the small of his back and pointed it at a deputy but did not shoot. He then turned the weapon on the sheriff and fired six shots, striking the victim sheriff in the front upper and lower torso, arms/hands, and fatally in the front below the waist. The victim sheriff was able to fire three rounds from his service weapon, striking the shooter twice. A deputy who was present also returned fire, striking the man several times before killing him. The 35-year-old man had a prior criminal record of violent crime, including police assault.",946
"A 42-year-old lieutenant with the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office was killed at 9:30 p.m. on September 3 while investigating a suspicious person. The lieutenant responded to a 911 call from a person who had reportedly witnessed a man setting fire to a residence in Carrollton. The witness also reported seeing the suspect fleeing with a can of gasoline from the burning dwelling, which was later discovered to be the suspect’s residence. The witness followed the man’s vehicle and continued to update the 911 center with information that was passed on to all patrol units. The veteran officer, with over 20 years of law enforcement experience, was the first officer to intercept the suspect’s vehicle. As the lieutenant attempted to pull over the suspect, a high-speed chase ensued. The alleged arsonist, who was reportedly distraught over his impending divorce, eventually stopped his vehicle and fled on foot, and the officer ran after him. The man entered a nearby residence where he allegedly fired 12 close-range rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, killing the 85-year-old owner. The suspect immediately exited the residence, firing additional rounds at the pursuing officer. One of the rounds fatally struck the victim officer in his chest. The suspect ran back into the house and then out again as he fired at officers who were arriving at the scene. The 31-year-old male, who had previous charges against him for Aggravated Assault with a Motor Vehicle, Fleeing and Attempting to Elude Officer for Felony, and Failure to Appear, was shot by the officers and died shortly after being transported to a local hospital.

"A 32-year-old veteran agent with the Police of Puerto Rico (POPR), who had nearly 11 years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot in the forehead at close range while on a special assignment in Juncos on May 22. Shortly before 8 in the evening, three special units of the POPR, San Juan, confronted a group of eight suspects in a well-known drug trafficking area. As officers questioned the group, one suspect jumped over a wire fence and fled the scene. One of the agents spotted a firearm in the waistband of the fleeing suspect and alerted the other officers. This agent pursued the suspect by running through a parallel street while two other agents attempted to follow directly behind the suspect. The other officers who were involved in the drug investigation stayed at the scene with the remaining suspects. During the chase, one of the three agents lost his radio. Another officer saw the suspect jump over another fence into a yard with plantain trees. The agent who had dropped his radio followed the suspect and began searching among the trees with a flashlight for the man. A radioed message alerted the agents that a firearm had been seized at the original arrest scene. Two of the agents returned to assist in the arrests and the securing of the remaining seven suspects. Moments later, two shots were heard, and a supervisory sergeant went to find the agent who had pursued the fleeing suspect. A distress call was issued, requesting assistance for a wounded officer. The victim agent, who was wearing protective body armor, was found unconscious with a shot to his head from an unknown caliber revolver. He was transported to a local hospital where he died a few hours later. Two days after the incident, investigators determined the identity and whereabouts of a 22-year-old male who was then arrested on charges of First-Degree Murder, Illegal Possession of a Firearm, and Illegal Discharge of a Firearm. The offender had a criminal history that included prior convictions for drug violations.",303
"At 3:08 p.m. on May 1, a 45-year-old sergeant and a 26-year-old trooper with the Fairbanks Detachment of the Alaska State Troopers were fatally wounded while attempting an arrest in Tanana. The sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 22½ years of experience, and the trooper, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 5 years of experience, arrived at a residence to serve an arrest warrant for a man charged with assault and driving on a revoked license. When the pair contacted the man outside his residence, he refused to cooperate and attempted to access the front door to go inside. As they tried to take him into custody, a struggle ensued causing the front door to open and all three men to fall onto the living room floor of the residence. The trooper removed his electronic control device and warned the suspect that he would use it unless the suspect complied. However, the suspect did not surrender, and the three continued to struggle until another man emerged from a room in the residence and fired seven rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The sergeant was hit in the neck/throat above his body armor, and a second round struck him fatally in the side of his head. The trooper’s body armor was penetrated by a round exceeding the vest’s specifications, striking the trooper in the rear upper torso/back and mortally wounding him. Both victim officers died at the scene. A civilian pilot with Tanana Village Public Safety responded and arrested the 20-year-old subject, who was a known user of controlled substances with a prior criminal record including drug violations. He was charged with two counts of First-Degree Murder and one count each of Second-Degree Murder, Third-Degree Assault, and Tampering with Physical Evidence.

"Four deputy sheriffs with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were shot, two of them killed and two injured, in an ambush after 3 p.m. on March 13 in Vansant. Earlier that day, a salvage yard owner called 911 concerning an attempted theft. The business owner had blocked the suspect’s car, and when salvage workers approached the suspect, he fled into the woods. In response, a 25-year-old deputy, who had over 6 years of law enforcement experience, and a 32-year-old deputy, who had over 10 years of law enforcement experience, arrived to take the report and process the scene. At 3:06 p.m., the 25- year-old deputy advised dispatch that he and the other deputy had shots fired upon them and that both were wounded and taking cover at a nearby residence. The 25-year-old deputy, who was wearing body armor, was hit in his arms/hands and in the rear lower torso/back when a round exceeded his vest’s specifications. The 32-year-old deputy, who was also wearing body armor, was struck in the rear of his head, his front upper torso/chest, and his rear upper torso/back when gunshots exceeded his vest’s specifications. Multiple units responded to the shooting, including a 46-year-old deputy with over 7 years of law enforcement experience who tried to assist another deputy in evacuating the wounded veteran deputies. However, the suspect fired additional shots from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle around 3:30 p.m., striking the 46-year-old veteran deputy in the front upper torso/chest. The rounds exceeded the specifications of the deputy’s body armor and he was killed. When more units responded, an investigator drove a car as a shield while the sheriff, a trooper, and a 41-year-old deputy made a second attempt to evacuate the wounded deputies around 3:55 p.m. The 41-year-old deputy, a veteran law enforcement officer with more than 10 years of service, was covering the rescue group with his rifle when he observed the suspect in the woods. With the sheriff’s approval, the deputy, who was wearing body armor, fired at the suspect. The suspect returned fire, fatally wounding the deputy in the front of his head. Over the next hour and a half, more law enforcement arrived to assist in the suspect’s apprehension. When he emerged from the woods to the road, the suspect was talking on a cell phone with his back to law enforcement officials. They approached the suspect and ordered him to put his hands up. Slightly after 5:30 p.m., following numerous commands, the suspect ended his call and turned toward law enforcement as he pulled a semiautomatic pistol and pointed it at the officers. Immediately, two officers fired upon the 52-year-old suspect, justifiably killing him at the scene. At the time of the report, one of the injured deputies had returned to duty, and the other injured deputy had not returned.",734
"On June 16, a 40-year-old captain with the St. John the Baptist Parish (SJBP) Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed while investigating suspects in an earlier nonfatal shooting of a 35-year-old SJBP deputy. In the initial incident, which occurred at 1:12 a.m., two deputies had attempted to pull over a vehicle with one male and one female occupant on a local highway. Suddenly, the driver made a U-turn and shot three rounds into the deputies’ unmarked police car, striking the leg of the deputy who was driving. The wounded 35-year-old deputy attempted to continue the pursuit of the suspects, but shortly radioed dispatch that he could not continue and pulled his car to the side of the road. An assisting deputy arrived on the scene and placed the victim deputy in his car to meet an ambulance that was en route, allowing the other deputy to resume the chase.

The 43-year-old sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with 17 years’ experience, stopped his police vehicle at 1:25 a.m. to talk with a man walking in a residential neighborhood. Once the sergeant obtained the subject’s identification and ran a warrant check through dispatch, he questioned the man about whether he had any weapons on him. When the sergeant asked the subject to step to the side, the subject produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired a single shot into the sergeant’s face at close range.

"U.S. Border Patrol and the National Park Service. A Border Patrol helicopter working in the area located the suspects and directed responding units to the site. The suspects tried to evade the pursuing Border Patrol units, but their vehicle eventually became stuck in a ravine. The two Mexican citizens fled from the vehicle in separate directions. One man ran northwest and was eventually captured with assistance from the Border Patrol helicopter. The second man ran south- west into a heavily vegetated area.

The 28-year-old assailant and the victim ranger both died from their wounds.",1062
"A trooper with the Michigan State Police (MSP), Oak Park Post, survived an assault with a firearm around 3:20 a.m. on February 11 while responding to a robbery in progress in Detroit. Throughout the night, two individuals allegedly had been posing as police officers and had committed a string of armed robberies and carjackings. They had also allegedly shot some of their victims. Recent radio communication conveyed that two troopers had spotted a vehicle matching the description of one of the carjacked vehicles, and the occupants matched the descriptions of the armed suspects. Upon seeing the troopers, the suspects abruptly pulled over and fled on foot. In response, at least 13 MSP troopers, an MSP K-9, and several Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers established a three-block perimeter in the neighborhood. MSP and DPD units coordinated efforts to restrict traffic, canvas streets in pairs, and clear vacant buildings in groups of four. After the K-9 lost the track in a vacant lot, an abandoned house nearby was determined to be a likely hideaway. Four troopers and the K-9 entered the structure and cleared the ground floor. However, when they began to clear the second level, two of the troopers came under fire. One of the troopers, a 13-year veteran of law enforcement who was wearing body armor, saw a flash from a bedroom facing the stairwell and then realized that he had been hit in the lower left leg. Both the 37-year-old victim trooper and his partner returned fire, took cover, and then established verbal contact with each other. The second trooper yelled for the subject to show his hands and drop his weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, but the subject did not comply. Upon hearing the exchange of gunfire and radio communications, MSP troopers and DPD officers who were at area perimeter points tightened the perimeter to the outside of the residence. One trooper with an M-4 rifle and two DPD officers entered and provided cover at the top of the stairwell for the wounded trooper and his partner. However, as the injured trooper and his partner moved toward the stairwell, a shot came from the bedroom where the subject was hiding. The troopers and officers returned fire, but the wounded trooper and his partner were forced to retreat back to the room. Covering officers continued to announce their presence and demand that the subject surrender. Meanwhile, officers outside observed a second subject climb out of an upstairs window and jump from a lower roof onto the ground; MSP troopers and DPD officers immediately took him into custody. Inside, law enforcement heard a weak voice come from the bedroom where the subject was hiding. When troopers again demanded his surrender, two gloved hands appeared, but the subject’s full body was not visible. The trooper and officers on the stairs entered the room under the cover of the trooper with the M-4 rifle and, after a brief struggle, secured the subject. Led by his partner, the victim trooper limped down the stairs, and then was carried by his partner to an emergency medical services unit that transported him to a local hospital. At the abandoned house, the 38-year-old subject from the upstairs and the 36-year-old subject who had been apprehended outside, both of whom had prior convictions for violent crime and weapons violations, were arrested and charged with Armed Robbery, Carjacking, Assault with Intent to Murder, Felon in Possession of a Firearm, and Weapon Felony Firearm. Additional charges for the 38-year-old were Weapon Felony Firearm; those for the 36-year-old were Conspiracy to Resist Arrest, Resisting and Obstructing (R & O) Causing Severe Impairment, R & O Causing Injury, eight counts of R & O, and Second-Degree Felony Firearm.

Around 11:20 p.m., a caller advised 911 dispatch that an individual had threatened to kill a cop, and Danville officers were in danger. Dispatchers then attempted to contact the DPD patrol officer several times on his radio and phone, but were unable to reach the veteran officer, who had 12 years of law enforcement experience.

Around this time, dispatch advised officers a fire had been set at a house, which turned out to be the residence of the suspect’s ex-girlfriend. The officers reported to a house near the ex-girlfriend’s residence to observe. The officers saw the suspect moving around inside the ex-girlfriend’s house. A short time later, the ex-girlfriend exited her house followed closely by the suspect. The DPD chief exited the neighbor’s residence and shouted commands for both individuals to get on the ground. The ex-girlfriend immediately complied, but the suspect fled on foot into the fenced area of a nearby football field. The suspect unsuccessfully attempted to scale the fence and briefly disappeared from the chief’s sight. Moments later, the suspect reappeared and, with his hands in the air, began walking toward the chief. The chief ordered the suspect to get on the ground, and this time, the suspect obeyed.

He then walked back to the road and hitchhiked to a bar, and from there he hitchhiked another ride to the vicinity of a hotel. During the ride to the hotel, the man made comments about having a violent confrontation with a police officer. The occupants of the second vehicle contacted the police after they dropped the man off and notified them of the man’s comments and his location. The following morning, officers located and arrested the alleged assailant, who was in possession of the gun used to kill the officer the previous night. The 22-year-old, who was on parole and had a prior criminal record that included police assault and weapons violations, was charged with First-Degree Murder, Fugitive from Justice, and Resisting Arrest.",309
"A veteran police officer with the Chicago Police Department died March 19 of injuries sustained the previous day while trying to serve a bench warrant. Shortly after 10 p.m. on March 18, the 47-year- old officer, with more than 20 years of experience in law enforcement, and his partner arrived at a residence to serve a bench warrant requiring the officers to bring the individual to court and authorizing forced entry into the residence, if necessary. Identifying themselves as police officers, the officers knocked on the door several times, but the occupant refused to open the door. A neighbor of the occupant also tried in vain to get the individual to open the door. Subsequently, the officer obtained a sledgehammer, again identified himself as a police officer, and asked that the occupant open the door. When the occupant still refused to open the door, the officer hit it with the sledgehammer. His partner heard a gunshot and saw the victim officer fall across the door’s threshold. The victim officer had been shot in the front of the head at close range with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The victim officer’s partner and the neighbor took cover while the suspect continued shooting. The partner called for help, and additional officers responded to the scene. While under fire, officers removed the victim officer from the scene and shot the 77-year-old suspect in return fire. More than 40 shots were fired during the incident. The victim officer and the suspect were taken to different hospitals. The suspect died at 11:30 p.m. on March 18, and the officer succumbed to his wounds shortly after midnight on March 19.",579
"On November 11 at 7:30 p.m., an off-duty agent with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, Oklahoma City, who was at home at the time, learned of the location of a known felon who was on probation for attempting to manufacture methamphetamine. The 38-year-old agent, who had more than 8 ½ years of law enforcement experience, left his house and went on duty in his bureau vehicle. The agent drove to where the suspect was and pulled him over in a traffic stop. The suspect exited his vehicle, and as the agent attempted to arrest him, a physical altercation erupted. The suspect managed to get back into his vehicle; however, the agent still was holding onto him. The man accelerated the car and attempted to leave the scene and escape arrest. The vehicle gained a high rate of speed as the suspect continued driving with the agent holding onto him. Eventually, the agent was able to draw his weapon and fire one shot, striking the suspect and subduing him. However, the agent lost his grip on the man and the vehicle, which was still moving, and he slid under the vehicle and was mortally wounded as it ran over him. The vehicle continued moving for approximately 30 yards and then struck a tree and stopped. The victim agent sustained fatal wounds to the side of his head in addition to injuries below his waist. He was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on November 18. The 29-year-old alleged assailant, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, suffered a life-threatening wound from the gunshot and was also transported to a local medical facility. After an extensive recovery period, the alleged assailant remained paralyzed from the middle of his chest to his feet. At the time this publication was compiled, murder charges had yet to be filed against the man, and a prior deferred sentence for drug abuse violations was to be revoked.",928
"Just after 9 p.m. on March 9, a 30-year-old police officer with 6 months of law enforcement experience with the Pomona Police Department (PPD) was shot and killed while responding to a disturbance call that ultimately became a tactical situation. Earlier on the day of the incident, officers had responded to a domestic disturbance call, but by the time officers arrived, the subject of the call had left in his vehicle. Family members of the subject decided to pursue him in their vehicle. The resulting pursuit was reported by witnesses, and PPD officers unsuccessfully attempted a traffic stop. The subject fled to his residence where he barricaded himself in a bedroom. Officers arrived at the scene and conducted a protective sweep of the residence and determined that it was empty other than the subject, who had barricaded himself in his room. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, approached the locked bedroom door using a ballistic shield. As the officer drew closer, the subject fired through the door with a .357-caliber revolver, fatally striking the victim officer in the front of the head just above the shield. Officers returned gunfire. The subject fired another round that ricocheted off the door and struck a 26- year-old PPD police officer in the side of the face, penetrating his cheek and lodging in his teeth. The wounded officer, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, was admitted to the hospital for treatment. After the victim officer and the wounded officer were extracted from the scene, members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Special Enforcement Bureau responded and employed tear gas and explosive breeches to force the subject from the residence. The 38-year-old subject was known to have a prior mental illness and was under the influence of amphetamines/methamphetamines and on parole at the time of the incident. He was arrested and charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, Felon in Possession of Firearm, Prohibited to Own Ammunition, Hit and Run Causing Injury, Evading Law Enforcement Officers, and Disregarding Safety. The 26-year-old officer who was wounded during the incident has since returned to duty.",751
"Approximately 2:30 a.m. in the darkness of a summer morning in the South, two law enforcement officers, who had 17 and 19 years of experience, respectively, responded to assist with the investigation of shots fired at the scene of a vehicle accident. Upon arriving at the scene, the officers saw four vehicles on the side of the roadway. An individual was lying on the roadway with a gunshot wound to the stomach, and two more gunshot victims were nearby. One officer stayed with the first victim, and the other officer approached a vehicle with darkly tinted windows. From inside the vehicle, a 20-year-old offender shot the officer in the upper body with a 12-gauge shotgun, knocking the officer down. As the officer got up and turned to retreat, the offender shot him in the back of the leg. The officer fell to the ground again. The offender then turned his weapon on himself and died of a self- inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. The officer recovered from his injuries and returned to full duty.",1223
"Approximately 5 o'clock on a clear summer evening in the West, two law enforcement officers-one a field-training officer with 4 years of experience and the other an officer-in-training with 1 year of experience-responded to a call involving an active shooter. The suspect's wife notified authorities that she had received a message from her husband on her cellphone that indicated he had possibly shot her mother and set fire to her mother's home. The message included photographs of the fire.  The officers learned the suspect's estranged wife had recently filed for divorce. The suspect had been granted visitation rights for their 14-month-old daughter and had picked her up a few days before but did not return the child on the specified day. On the day of the incident, the man drove his daughter to his mother-in-law's residence, parked his truck on the street in front, and shot his daughter twice in the head, killing her. Witnesses saw the man walk into the residence carrying a firearm. While inside, the offender shot and killed his mother-in-law and set fire to her residence.  When the officers arrived at the scene, they observed smoke coming from the residence. The field-training officer took a tactical position of cover behind the offender's truck where the 14-month-old-victim was located, still seated in her car seat. The officer-in-training approached the residence from the side. The offender, who was on the front porch, fired several rounds from his .45-caliber semiautomatic firearm at the field-training officer, who was still located behind the truck. One of the rounds struck the field-training officer in the head, causing a nonfatal wound; the round traveled down his skull and exited his neck. The injured field-training officer fired three rounds from his  .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, but none of the rounds hit the offender. The officer-in-training, who had taken cover behind the patrol vehicle, was within sight of the victim officer. The victim officer attempted to run to the officer-in-training, but due to his diminished motor skills, fell onto the roadway. The officer-in-training ran to the aid of the fallen officer and dragged him to safety. Additional officers arrived and transported the victim officer to a nearby ambulance, which took him to a local hospital. The fire department, with assistance from law enforcement, extinguished the house fire. Inside, emergency personnel found the bodies of the offender and his mother-in-law. The 32-year-old offender died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.",1227
"A 43-year-old police officer with the San Diego Police Department (SDPD) was killed and a 32-year-old police officer with the SDPD was wounded shortly before 11 p.m. on July 28, while investigating a suspicious person. The pair were in their patrol unit when they saw two males in the middle of a street walking away from each other. One of the men was carrying a white plastic bag with something solid inside. The 43-year-old police officer, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 16 years of experience, stopped the patrol unit slightly behind the man with the bag. The 32-year-old officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 9 years of experience, exited the passenger’s side of the patrol unit and asked the man where he lived. The man turned and fired at the 32-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, with a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. A round struck the officer in the neck/throat and he fell onto his back near the passenger side at the rear of the patrol unit. The assailant continued to fire his weapon while advancing on the other officer, who was still sitting in the driver’s seat. The assailant entered the patrol unit’s open door on the passenger’s side and shot the 43-year-old officer at close range in the rear of his head, his front upper torso/chest, and his arms/hands. The victim officer was wearing body armor, but a round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of the vest. The injured officer outside of the vehicle was able to draw his service weapon and fire on the fleeing assailant, striking him with one of the rounds. Responding officers found the 43-year-old victim officer slumped over in the driver’s seat. He was taken by ambulance to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The other injured officer was taken by ambulance to a local hospital and suffered a collapsed lung. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured officer had not returned to duty. Officers located the 52-year-old assailant later on the day of the incident. He was arrested and charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon in Possession of a Firearm. The assailant, who had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, drug law violation, and weapons violation, was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident.",41
"On November 10, approximately 3:20 a.m., a 52-year-old Canonsburg Police Department (CPD) patrol officer was killed, and a 47-year-old CPD patrol officer was injured, while responding to a domestic violence complaint. The 52-year-old officer, a nearly 8-year veteran of law enforcement, exited his vehicle and walked toward the residence as the 47-year-old officer, a veteran with over 22 years of law enforcement experience, arrived as backup. The 52-year-old officer was shot at from a second floor window with a .30-06 bolt-action rifle and was struck in the front below the waist and fatally in the front lower torso/stomach when the round entered below his body armor. The victim officer was able to fire 15 rounds at the suspect. While still in the patrol vehicle, the assisting officer, who was also wearing body armor, was wounded when one round entered between the side panels of his protective vest and struck him in the rear lower torso/back. A responding CPD sergeant arrived and saw the 52-year-old patrol officer on the ground. He drove his vehicle through the line of fire near the fallen officer and moved the officer partially into the vehicle. A Peters Township Police Department (PTPD) sergeant and a Cecil Township Police Department sergeant arrived to assist the CPD sergeant in getting the 52-year-old victim officer into a patrol vehicle and driving him to a hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries. The CPD sergeant then drove another patrol vehicle through the line of fire to assist the 47-year-old victim officer. The sergeant put the officer into the vehicle and drove him to an ambulance which was located further down the road. The 47-year-old victim officer was transported to a local hospital and was later flown to another hospital for surgery. The PTPD sergeant maintained cover for the other officers. The subject shot at the remaining officers and also fired upon a vehicle parked along the street in front of the residence. It was later discovered the subject had previously loaded the vehicle with gasoline, propane, and acetylene tanks. Although struck at least twice, the vehicle did not ignite. Many local departments, including a SWAT team, arrived and surrounded the residence. Due to the previous explosive device, a robot was used to make entry into the residence where more propane tanks and a lit acetylene torch were discovered. The suspect’s wife was found deceased from multiple gunshot wounds. The 47-year-old subject was found dead. He had committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the 47-year-old CPD victim officer had not yet returned to duty.",160
"A 48-year-old patrol officer with the Moscow Police Department (MPD) was shot and killed in an ambush at 11:30 p.m. on May 19. The patrol officer, who had a little more than 6 years of law enforcement experience, and his 30-year-old partner, who had less than a year of law enforcement experience, responded to a call of shots fired into the Latah County Sheriff’s Office (LCSO) and dispatch center at the county courthouse. Several deputies and dispatchers took cover inside the building as a man fired shots from outside the building with a .308-caliber semiautomatic rifle before he took cover behind a cement retaining wall. When they arrived at the courthouse, the patrol officers approached the parking lot, and the man shot at them from more than 50 feet away. Although the patrol officers were both wearing protective body armor, a bullet hit the victim patrol officer in the chest, fatally wounding him as the powerful round penetrated his vest. The victim officer’s partner was also wounded in the front below the waist by bullet fragments. A civilian attempted to aid the fallen officers, but the gunman shot the man three times, critically wounding him. Officers from the MPD and deputies from the LCSO used the personal vehicle of a sergeant from the sheriff’s office in an attempt to rescue the downed patrol officers. After the wounded officers were placed in the vehicle, a 46-year-old sergeant with the LCSO, who had 17 years of law enforcement experience, attempted to take cover behind a tree. He was shot in the right forearm and right hip by the gunman, who had moved to the inside of a church across the street from the sheriff’s office. Inside the church, the offender also shot and killed a church employee who attempted to call 911. The gunman held up inside the church until the following afternoon when, after the last shot was heard from inside the church, officers moved in and found the man dead of a self- inflicted gunshot wound to his head. In addition to the .308-caliber semiautomatic rifle, the gunman also used an AK-47 style weapon in the shootout in which he fired a total of 160 shots. Investigators determined that the 36-year-old man had prior mental disorders and a prior criminal record that included violent crimes, and drug and weapons charges. The investigation also found that at the time of the incident, he was on probation and under the influence of drugs and alcohol. On May 20, investigators went to the home of the gunman, just outside of Moscow, and they found his wife dead of a gunshot wound to her head. They believe her husband killed her before driving to the courthouse.",446
"On February 25 at 12:04 p.m., a 30-year-old police officer with the Pittsburg Police Department (PPD) suffered minor injuries while attempting to restrain an offender. The officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, along with two members of the Crisis Negotiation Team and others, responded to a call for service involving domestic violence between a father and a son at the father’s residence. The caller reported that the son was using a knife with a 4-inch blade to stab and slash into the metal screen security door and the exterior of the residence. Dashboard and body camera footage show that officers encountered the suspect about a block away from the residence, still armed with the knife. Officers repeatedly ordered the subject to drop the knife, but he did not comply. An officer deployed a less-lethal round, striking the subject in his abdomen to no effect, possibly because the subject was wearing a bulky jacket and was under the influence of amphetamine/methamphetamine. After again ordering the suspect to drop the knife, a second officer deployed an electronic control weapon, striking the subject in his temple and his chest to no effect. The subject continued to ignore commands to drop the knife, so the first officer fired another less-lethal round, striking the subject in the chest. At the same time, a third officer deployed her electronic control weapon, striking the subject in the chest, but these tactics were also not effective. A fourth officer deployed his K-9, who bit the subject’s left forearm. The subject tried to stab the K-9, so the 30-year-old PPD officer tackled the offender. During the ensuing physical altercation, the offender stabbed the 30-year-old PPD officer above his body armor, striking his left shoulder (upper torso) area. Another officer disarmed the offender and assisting officers handcuffed him and placed him in a restraint device because of his continued combative behavior. The injured officer was treated for his wound. He has since returned to duty. The 33-year-old offender was transported to a local hospital, then arrested and charged with Assault with Deadly Weapon—Not Firearm, Obstructing/Resisting Executive Officer, Use/Under the Influence of Controlled Substance. His criminal history included charges for aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, domestic violence, a drug law violation, a weapons violation, and robbery.",839
"Around 6:15 p.m. on May 2, a police officer with the New York Police Department (NYPD) was shot while investigating suspicious persons or circumstances. Two police officers were performing an anticrime patrol and were wearing plainclothes in an unmarked police vehicle. As they pulled alongside a man on the sidewalk on the driver’s side of the vehicle, the man produced a .380-caliber revolver and discharged three rounds at the officers. The driver of the patrol vehicle, a 25-year-old officer who had nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor, was struck in the side of his head. He also suffered injuries to the front and rear of his head. The suspect fled the scene on foot. The officer in the passenger seat immediately rendered first aid to the victim officer and called for assistance.

"A 38-year-old detective and a 51-year-old sergeant with the Santa Cruz Police Department were killed while attempting an arrest around 3:25 p.m. on February 26. The detective, a 10-year veteran of law enforcement, and the sergeant, a 28-year veteran of law enforcement, went to the residence of a man to obtain a statement concerning a sexual assault in which the man was reported as a suspect. On February 22, the suspect had been arrested for public intoxication at the residence of a co-worker. Reportedly, the suspect had been out with a group that night, including the co-worker. The suspect parted company with them, but ended up back at the co-worker’s residence and refused to leave. The officers who responded that night jailed the suspect for 5 hours and then released him. The following day, a woman who had been at the residence reported that the man had sexually assaulted her during the incident that led to his arrest for public intoxication. The detective and the sergeant followed up on the accusation on February 26. About 2:50 p.m., the officers arrived at the suspect’s residence and knocked on the door, but no one answered. Looking through a window, the officers saw someone inside. The sergeant identified himself as a law enforcement officer, and the detective attempted to call the suspect’s phone twice, but the man did not answer. Shortly after 3 p.m., the officers noticed a man outside the residence that appeared to be the suspect. They questioned the man, determined he was not the suspect, and returned to the suspect’s residence. About 3:15 p.m., the sergeant observed a man inside the residence. The man remained inside, but began to talk to the officers through the windows and doors. The man asked if the officers were going to arrest him. The officers told him several times they wanted to get his account of the events from February 22. At 3:18 p.m., the detective lost sight of the man and she expressed concern that they may need another police unit. The officers continued to talk with the suspect, who remained inside the residence. The officers eventually told the suspect he was under arrest and instructed him to come outside. After about 5 minutes, when the suspect did not exit, the officers walked to the back of the house on opposite sides of the residence and ended up on opposite sides of the back door. The sergeant looked through a window and saw the suspect heading to the back of the house. The sergeant informed the detective that the suspect was going to the back door. Seconds later, the man exited the back door with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired two rounds at the detective. The first round struck the detective in her arms/hands, and the second round hit her in the front of the head, killing her instantly. The suspect then turned toward the sergeant and fired three times. The sergeant attempted to dive for cover but was fatally wounded by rounds that struck him in the rear lower torso/back. The suspect walked up to the sergeant and fired three more rounds into the rear of his head. The suspect took the sergeant’s firearm from its holster, walked over to the detective and shot her in the side of the head. The man also took the detective’s firearm from its holster and left the scene in the sergeant’s unmarked vehicle. Shortly after 3:25 p.m., several residents in the nearby area called 911 to report hearing gunshots. Responding officers arrived at the scene within minutes and found the victim officers. The officers cleared the residence and surrounding area to ensure the suspect was not there, then established a perimeter and searched house-to-house for the suspect. An officer at the scene noticed a man attempting to hide behind a fence that ran between a neighboring residence and an apartment complex. The officer engaged the man and asked him to show his hands. The man did not show his hands to the officer, and the officer could not see him completely behind the fence. Other officers recognized it was the suspect hiding at the fence. Additional officers arrived and took up positions at the entrance of the apartment complex. The suspect turned and ran toward the driveway of the apartment complex and fired at officers from handguns he was carrying in each hand. Four officers fired back at the suspect as he attempted to take cover behind a cinderblock wall. Hit by several rounds, the man fell to the ground. As the suspect reached his hand into a bag he was carrying, an officer shot him in the head, justifiably killing the suspect. Further investigation revealed that the suspect owned one of the handguns he was carrying and the other one belonged to the victim detective. The 35-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident and had a criminal record that included violent crime and weapons violations, was also found wearing the victim sergeant’s body armor under a sweatshirt. The investigation also revealed that the suspect knew one of the victim officers through a previous law enforcement encounter.",362

"A 59-year-old sergeant with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Department died on August 24 as a result of line- of-duty injuries sustained in Apache Junction on December 11, 1993. Just after 4 p.m. on the day of the incident, the officer, then a corporal with more than 6 years’ law enforcement experience, and other officers responded to a domestic/disturbance call at a residence.

The officer pushed the emergency button to shut off the pumps and deployed an electronic control device, striking the subject once. The subject produced a knife and stabbed the officer repeatedly. After struggling on the ground, the subject lost control of the knife but produced a screwdriver and continued to stab the officer. During the attack, the officer removed his service weapon from its holster and fired the weapon, striking and killing the offender. Despite multiple injuries to his front upper torso/chest, arms/hands, and a deep puncture wound to the right thigh, the officer was able to get out from under the subject and call for backup.

A 31-year-old veteran officer, with more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence and asked the man about the whereabouts of his wife, who had placed the call. The man advised his wife was no longer there and then he attempted to close the door; however, the officer blocked the door with his foot and tried to force his way into the residence to investigate. Moments after the initial contact, a 33-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 10 years of law enforcement experience, and the 28-year-old officer, who was in training with 3 months of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene to assist. During the veteran officers’ attempt to force open the door, the suspect retrieved a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle and opened fire from the partially opened door. All three officers were wearing body armor, but their close proximity to the door gave them no response time. The 31-year-old victim officer was struck in the front below his waist, and the 28-year-old victim officer was struck in her rear upper torso/back by gunfire, which entered the armhole/shoulder area of her body armor, and in the rear below her waist.

The third victim officer, the 33-year-old, was unable to move more than 10 feet from the door due to his injuries. He had been shot in his front upper torso/chest, the front below his waist, and his arms/hands. Responding officers provided field trauma treatment on all three victim officers before they were transported to a nearby trauma center via helicopter.

The officer used his overhead lights and initiated a traffic stop. The officer exited his patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver. The driver handed the officer a Texas identification card and stated he did not have insurance on the vehicle. The officer returned to his patrol vehicle to check for warrants and discovered the driver had multiple outstanding arrest warrants. The officer requested assistance and intended to arrest the driver for the outstanding warrants. The officer returned to the stopped vehicle and asked the man to exit and walk back to the patrol vehicle. The man exited, turned away from the officer, and began walking quickly toward the patrol vehicle. The man’s hands were concealed inside his jacket, and his pace and tense body language indicated that he might flee. The officer grasped the man’s left elbow and forearm in an escort hold and prepared to handcuff the man. The man ignored the officer’s instructions to put his hands on the hood of the patrol vehicle and continued walking. The officer placed one handcuff on the man’s left wrist, and the man spun around counterclockwise and used his right hand to strike the officer in the left rib cage area approximately three times. The officer continued to struggle with the man and noticed a knife in his right hand. The officer then realized the man had been attempting to stab him when he had been struck in the rib cage, but the knife could not penetrate his body armor. The man continued to try to free his right arm and ignored the officer’s verbal commands. The officer warned he would shoot the man if he did not drop the knife. The man continued to struggle; the officer placed his firearm, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, against the man’s left lower back and fired two rounds. The man fell, and the officer, still holding the handcuffs, fell on top of the man straddling him near the waist. The officer attempted to get up to create a safe distance between them, but the man sat up and stabbed the officer twice in the left thigh with the knife. The officer realized the man was still attempting to injure or kill him, and the officer fired two more rounds, hitting the man. The officer then looked down and realized the knife was embedded in his thigh. He pulled the knife out and used his handheld radio to call for help. He then fell to the ground while keeping his firearm pointed at the subject. Backup officers and medical units arrived a short time later. The 27-year-old subject had been justifiably killed by the victim officer. The subject was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident and had a prior criminal record for a violent crime, a weapons violation, and a drug law violation. The officer recovered from his injuries and returned to duty.",1181
"A master deputy with the York County Sheriff’s Office (YCSO) was killed, and two YCSO sergeants and a York Police Department (YPD) sergeant were wounded while responding to a domestic violence complaint in York on January 16. All four officers were veteran law enforcement officers and were wearing body armor during the incident. Upon arrival at the residence, responding officers learned that the armed suspect, who was under the influence of alcohol, had fled the residence. Deputies called for assistance in the search from the K-9 unit, the SWAT team, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division’s helicopter. When the K-9 unit arrived, they initiated a search in a wooded area near the residence. At 1:09 a.m., the suspect fired his 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle at the officers and severely injured a 56-year-old YCSO sergeant with the K-9 unit in the front of his legs/feet. The sergeant, who had nearly 34 years of law enforcement experience, was transported to the hospital. The suspect also fired at and struck the helicopter but did not injure the two pilots. The suspect continued to flee. Law enforcement officers eventually located the suspect when he fired on them from under the deck of a residence in the neighborhood. Around 3:31 a.m., the suspect shot three more officers: the 37-year-old master deputy was hit in the front of his head, a 49-year-old YCSO sergeant was wounded in the front of his legs/feet, and a 34-year-old YPD sergeant sustained injuries to the front below the waist/groin area. These three victim officers were also transported to a local hospital. The master deputy, who had nearly 13 years of law enforcement experience, died the next day. The YCSO sergeant, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and the YPD sergeant, who had 13 ½ years of law enforcement experience, were both severely injured. Neither of these two wounded sergeants, nor the sergeant with the K-9 unit, had returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 47-year-old suspect was also transported to the hospital where he was treated for injuries sustained during the incident. He was charged with Murder, three counts of Attempted Murder, and three counts of Possession of a Weapon during the Commission of a Violent Crime. His criminal history included a charge of resisting arrest.",525
"A 29-year-old agent with the Police of Puerto Rico, San Juan, was fatally shot during an undercover drug operation in Rio Piedras at 4:30 a.m. on September 26. Shortly after arriving in civilian clothes at a housing project and exiting their un- marked vehicles, the veteran agent with 7 years’ law enforcement experience and a dozen other agents overheard shouts throughout the housing project warning of the presence of law enforcement. Moments later, a series of shots rang out from the upper levels of two high- rise buildings, striking the parking lot below. Police agents took cover behind their vehicles and requested assistance. For approximately 7 minutes, snipers fired about 50 rounds from high-powered rifles. At some point in the attack, one round struck the victim agent in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Remaining agents and responding tactical units raided the upper floors of the buildings and recovered three rifles, a pistol, and large quantities of heroin and cocaine. Although seven individuals were detained immediately following the incident, all were subsequently released. The investigation is ongoing.",256
