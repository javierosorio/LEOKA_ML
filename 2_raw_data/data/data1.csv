"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence.

The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects.

"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene.

On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected.

"Two detectives with the Miami-Dade Police Department were killed while attempting an arrest shortly after 11 a.m. on January 20 in Miami. When a murder investigation revealed that the individual wanted for the crime could be in one of three places, four detectives went to one of the locations, the apartment duplex of the individual’s mother.

Outside, the 41-year-old detective who was covering the west side of the duplex heard the shots, left his position, and headed toward the front of the apartment. As the assailant exited the residence, he shot the detective at the front entrance. The veteran detective, who had more than 21 years of law enforcement experience, was wearing body armor, but a fatal round struck him in the side of his head. The alleged assailant continued down a walkway next to the residence where he was confronted by the detective who had been on the east side of the complex. The detective shot and killed the 23-year-old offender, who had a prior criminal record that included violent crime, drug violations, police assault, and weapons violations. The offender, who was on probation at the time of the incident, was acquainted with the victim detectives through a previous law enforcement relationship.",1033
"Just before 3:30 a.m. on August 4, a police officer with the New Orleans Police Department was shot and killed while investigating a robbery in progress at a neighborhood bar. The 35-year-old officer had more than 4 years’ experience in law enforcement and was acting as Field Training Officer to his partner, a recent graduate of the police academy, when the call of a robbery in progress was dispatched. Responding to the dispatched call, the officers sat in their marked car across the intersection from the bar and observed that no activity was occurring outside the establishment. As the officers approached the bar in their cruiser, the robbers inside saw the police arrive and began a frantic search for an alternate exit. At some point, one of the suspects ordered the bartender to release the lock on the front door, and the suspect exited just as the officers drove past the door. Reportedly, he immediately fired 6 rounds from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun toward the passenger door of the police car as the victim officer attempted to exit the vehicle. Although the officer was wearing body armor, one of the bullets struck him fatally in the front of the head. The four men reported to be involved in the robbery— two aged 20, one aged 31, and one aged 35–were all arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder and 16 counts of Armed Robbery.",763

"On August 5 at 11:40 p.m., a patrol officer with the Conway Police Department was injured while handling a person with a mental illness. The 27-year-old officer, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, responded to a residence after dispatchers received a 911 hang-up call. The dispatcher advised that the caller stated he did not trust himself, and then the call was disconnected. Upon arriving at the residence, the man who answered the door informed the officer that he had not called 911 but his adult son may have called. The subject’s mother told the officer her son was outside and very intoxicated. She led the officer into the house, downstairs into the basement, and out to the backyard. The officer observed the subject sitting in a chair crying with his head between his legs. While the officer was questioning him about the 911 call, the man sat up, took a knife from his sweatshirt pocket, and stated, “I cannot take this anymore.” The officer ordered the subject to put the knife down and called for dispatchers to have another unit respond to the location. After the officer again gave orders for the subject to drop the knife, the subject, using his right hand, put the knife to his own throat and began to draw it across his neck. The subject’s mother started to walk toward the subject to stop him, but he ordered her to stay away. The officer, who was wearing body armor, grabbed the man’s right hand and took him to the ground. Once on the ground, the officer gave a final order for the subject to drop the knife, and the subject responded, “I hope you have had some good training if you’re going to get this away from me.” The officer then used chemical spray on the man in an attempt to disarm him; however, the spray seemed to have no effect. While the officer was on top of the subject, the man’s father attempted to assist the officer in removing the knife from his son’s hand. The officer was able to pry the knife away from the subject and throw it off to the side. The officer then secured the suspect in handcuffs, placing his hands behind his back and double locking the cuffs. The officer sustained minor cuts on his left hand during the struggle. While waiting for backup, the subject’s mother told the officer that her son had remarked earlier that he wanted the police to come so they could end it all. After additional officers arrived, medical personnel evaluated the 30-year-old subject. The subject was transported to the police department where officers completed a suicide evaluation and charged the subject with Resisting Arrest or Detention and Second-Degree Assault. After the booking process, the victim officer went to the hospital and was treated for the cuts on his hands and returned to duty. The subject was known to use drugs, had a prior criminal record that included drug convictions, and he was under conditional release at the time of the incident. In an interview the next day, the man stated he was depressed and had been drinking alcohol that night after fighting with his girlfriend. He told the officer he wanted to kill himself and tried to cut his throat using a knife but was unsuccessful. When he called 911 and the officer arrived, the subject reported he had no intention of cutting the officer, but he wanted the officer to shoot him.",1172
"A 25-year-old recruit officer with the Amarillo Police Department was shot and injured while answering a call for service on August 31. At 3:44 a.m., the recruit, who had 3 months of law enforcement experience, and a senior officer were dispatched to investigate a glass break alarm at a local business. As the officers neared the scene, they noticed a subject on the street waving his hand to attract their attention, so they pulled over and got out of the patrol unit to speak with him. The subject said he walked by the business, heard the alarm, and saw two people riding away on bicycles. The subject stated he had recently been released from prison and did not want to get into trouble. The officers observed the subject acting suspiciously; he was unsteady on his feet and kept repeating himself. The officers checked the contents of the subject’s backpack. Then, as the subject sat on the curb, the senior officer got into the patrol unit to run a computer check. The computer returned a parole warrant for the subject’s arrest, so the senior officer exited the patrol unit and informed the subject he was under arrest. The subject immediately ran. The officer deployed his electronic control weapon, which was ineffective. The subject ran into the side yard of a residence and was blocked by a wooden fence, so he stopped and turned toward the officers. The subject produced a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired four rounds at the officers while walking toward them. The officers returned fire, striking the subject and causing him to fall to the ground. The recruit, who was wearing body armor, was struck by one round in the front of his legs/feet. The officers could not see the subject’s hands or the firearm he had used, so the senior officer held the fallen subject at gunpoint while he radioed dispatch to report the updated situation. A backup officer covered the senior officer as he handcuffed the subject. Officers found the firearm in the grass near where the subject had been shot. Medical personnel arrived and treated both the recruit and the subject at the scene, then transported them to the hospital. The recruit underwent surgery to remove a round from his foot. At the time of the incident, the subject was under the influence of heroin and amphetamines/methamphetamines. On September 7, the 24-year-old subject was released from the hospital and immediately arrested and charged with First-Degree Attempted Capital Murder. Known to the police department as a user of a controlled substance and for theft, he had previous arrests including a drug law violation, a violent crime, and resisting arrest. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the victim recruit officer had not returned to duty.",7
"At 4 a.m. on October 28, a 45-year-old police officer with the Pomona Police Department was wounded during a tactical situation in San Gabriel. The officer was part of a SWAT team tasked with serving a warrant for an investigation involving a motorcycle gang. As the SWAT team prepared to breach the front entrance of a residence, the officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 16 years’ experience, pierced the screen door and pulled it open. At the same time, a man inside the residence opened the interior wooden door, which swung back into the living area. Another man stationed himself behind the man who opened the door and fired a single shot from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun toward the officer. The shot passed through the arm of the man who opened the door and hit the officer in the neck/throat above his body armor. The victim officer immediately fell to the ground. SWAT team members entered the residence. As SWAT personnel detained subjects inside and secured visible weapons, a SWAT medic at the scene gave the victim officer medical aid. He was transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment. Meanwhile, officers arrested a 36-year-old man, who had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, drug violations, and weapons violations, and who had been convicted previously.

"At 5:20 p.m. on January 17, a senior police officer with the Livonia Police Department was killed during an investigative activity as he was working undercover. The 48-year-old officer, who had 20 years of law enforcement experience, was a member of a surveillance unit watching an individual and his brother whom police believed were responsible for a number of home invasions. Members of the unit witnessed the pair committing a home invasion in Walled Lake. When officers tried to apprehend the men, one individual fled on foot with the senior police officer in pursuit. While the other officers were apprehending the individual’s brother, they heard gunshots. Officers immediately responded and found the veteran senior police officer and the individual both dead with gunshot wounds. It is believed that the victim officer, who was wearing body armor, chased the offender through a yard that was surrounded by a privacy fence. When confronted, the offender turned and fired five rounds from a .45- caliber semiautomatic handgun at the officer from close range. Although the officer’s body armor stopped a round to his back, he was struck in the thigh, hip, buttocks, and fatally in the side of his head. Despite his injuries, the officer was able to fire two rounds from his .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, both of which hit the 44-year-old offender, killing him.

He also had a prior criminal record that included violent crime, drug violations, and weapons violations.",701
"About 11:40 p.m. on May 16, a deputy sheriff with the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department was shot during a traffic stop in Somers. The 48-year-old veteran deputy sheriff, who had nearly 18 years of law enforcement experience, attempted to stop a vehicle on a rural road for a traffic violation. After the deputy turned on his emergency lights, the driver of the vehicle continued at a slow speed. Another deputy joined the slow speed pursuit and followed in his patrol vehicle. The suspect continued driving his vehicle for approximately one half mile, turned into a subdivision, and proceeded to the end of a cul- de-sac. The driver pulled the vehicle into a driveway and stopped near the back of the residence. The deputy sheriff who had initiated the traffic stop pulled in behind the vehicle with his emergency lights still on and his spotlight focused on the vehicle. The deputy sheriff, who was wearing body armor, exited his vehicle. He approached the suspect’s vehicle and ordered the driver to get out. The suspect opened the driver’s door, pointed a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the deputy sheriff, and fired. A round from the weapon deflected off the deputy’s shoulder microphone and went into his neck. The victim deputy returned fire, but the suspect shot another round that struck the deputy in the face, fatally wounding him. As the victim deputy fell to the ground, a third round struck him in the thigh. The assisting deputy sheriff took cover and fired 11 rounds at the suspect, who fled into a nearby wooded area. On the following day, the victim deputy sheriff succumbed to his wounds, and tactical units captured the 44-year-old alleged shooter and charged him with First-Degree Intentional Homicide. The man, who had been under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record that included violent crimes and weapons violations.",582
"Five law enforcement officers were killed and 11 were injured in an ambush (entrapment and premeditation) shortly before 9 p.m. on July 7 in Dallas. Officers from the Dallas Police Department (DPD) and the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Department (DART PD) were working traffic control for a protest march in downtown Dallas. A senior corporal and two officers with the DPD were stationed at a roadblock at an intersection. After the marchers passed them, a man sitting in a vehicle nearby opened fire on the officers with a 5.45x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. All three law enforcement officers were fatally wounded. The 48-year-old senior corporal, a 14-year veteran of law enforcement, sustained injuries to his front lower torso/stomach, front below the waist, arms/hands, and fatally, to his front upper torso/chest. A 40-year-old veteran officer who had nearly 9 years of law enforcement experience was wounded in the front lower torso/stomach, front below waist, arms/hands, and mortally in the front upper torso/chest. The third victim officer, who was 32 years old and a law enforcement veteran with 6 years of experience, was shot in the front lower torso/stomach and fatally in his front upper torso/chest. Both the 40-year-old and the 32-year-old victim officers were wearing body armor, but the rounds exceeded their vests’ specifications. The subject continued firing his weapon, wounding several other DPD officers and two civilians. From the opposite direction, a veteran officer with the DART PD shot at the subject, striking him with three rounds; however, the subject turned and opened fire at him from close range. The 43-year-old DART PD officer, who had 13 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor, was shot in the front upper torso/chest, rear upper torso/back, front lower torso/stomach, rear below his waist, front below his waist, and fatally in the side of his head. Additional officers arrived at the scene, including members of the Dallas County Community College Police Department. They exchanged gunfire with the subject, who wounded more officers. The man entered a building in a nearby college and moved up to the second floor. From a window on the second floor, the subject fired at officers below. A 55-year-old sergeant with the DPD was struck in the front upper torso/chest, front lower torso/stomach, front below waist, and arms/hands. The veteran sergeant, who had nearly 27 years of law enforcement experience, died from wounds to the front upper torso/chest from rounds that penetrated his body armor because they exceeded the vest’s specifications. Officers who had followed after the man into the building and up to the second floor chased him through several long hallways, at times exchanging gunfire, until the subject stopped and waited in a tactical position. After hours of failed negotiations, officers used an explosive device and the 25-year-old suspect was killed. The suspect had no known criminal record and was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident.",732
"More officers arrived, including the 48-year-old sergeant from the SPPD. Around 7:43 a.m., the sergeant and other officers entered the residence and moved towards the attic opening where the fallen K-9 officer’s foot was visible. The officers used semiautomatic rifles to cover the sergeant, who held a ballistic shield as he moved under the attic entrance toward the officers still in the bathroom. As the sergeant passed under the attic entrance, the fugitive shot him with the K-9 officer’s service weapon. The round hit the sergeant in the back but was deflected by his body armor. The fugitive fired two more rounds—one glanced the sergeant’s ballistic shield and the other struck the sergeant’s chest, above his protective vest, and traveled through his torso. The other officers fired into the attic, and the sergeant crawled from the hallway into a bedroom. Another officer got on the ladder and pulled on the K-9 officer’s foot but was unable to move him. The fugitive began firing at the officer, who fell off the ladder then took cover in the bathroom. There, the officer broke out the window and assisted the patrol officer in helping the injured deputy marshal outside. The officer then broke the bedroom window from the exterior and entered the bedroom where the injured sergeant was lying. When the fugitive began shooting in that direction, the officer blocked the door with a cabinet, preventing a clear shot into the bedroom. Officers removed the victim sergeant through the bedroom window. He was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead from the chest wound received from the suspect’s 9 mm semiautomatic handgun.",1164

One of the men, armed with a handgun, took off running through the neighborhood. The officers initiated a foot pursuit, and in the course of the chase, gunfire was exchanged. One of the officers, who was wearing body armor, was shot in the arm by a round from the suspect’s 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. A second LAPD cruiser arrived on the scene, and two more officers joined the exchange of gunfire.

"An Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper was shot and critically wounded while answering a call for service in Maricopa County around 4:30 a.m. on January 12. At 4:21 a.m., the 911 call center received two calls regarding the same stretch of interstate—one to report an individual shooting at a vehicle and one to report an individual dragging another person from the road. At 4:33 a.m., the 52-year-old veteran trooper, who had 27 years of law enforcement experience, responded to the scene and discovered a rollover vehicle crash. He asked dispatch to request a helicopter for a female had been ejected from the vehicle. Shortly after, the trooper informed dispatch he had closed one lane of traffic. About that time, a man who had been involved in the crash emerged and fired a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at the trooper. One round struck the trooper in the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. The suspect then sat on top of the trooper and struck him repeatedly in the face with both fists. A citizen and his companion driving past the scene noticed the assault and stopped to assist the trooper. The citizen—armed with a personally-owned firearm—approached the scene on foot and ordered the suspect to get off the trooper. The suspect ignored the citizen’s command and resumed beating the trooper; the citizen fired two rounds that struck the suspect in the thigh and the head. The rounds knocked the suspect off the trooper allowing the citizen to administer first aid to the trooper. Suddenly, the suspect recovered and lunged at the pair, so the citizen fired another round that struck the suspect in the head a second time. During this time, the citizen’s companion called 911 to report their location to dispatch and used the trooper’s first aid kit to administer additional care to the trooper. The citizen began to flag down traffic and a third person stopped his vehicle to assist. He used the trooper’s radio to again request help. About 6 minutes after the third person called for help, a DPS sergeant arrived and secured the area. The victim trooper was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he underwent multiple surgeries to repair a gunshot wound to his right shoulder and numerous facial lacerations and contusions. The 37-year-old suspect, who was under the influence of amphetamines/methamphetamines at the time of the incident, was justifiably killed by the first citizen at the scene. The investigation revealed the car crash involved the suspect and his girlfriend, who was the woman flown by helicopter to a hospital. She was pronounced dead later that morning. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the victim trooper had not returned to duty.",73
"Both a deputy sheriff and a sergeant with the Nicholas County Sheriff’s Department (NCSD) survived wounds sustained while responding to a disturbance call in Beaver and participating in the tactical situation to address the subsequent standoff at the residence. At approximately 9:21 a.m. on July 6, two NCSD deputies responded to a caller who reported that a man who was on the porch of a neighboring residence was armed with a shotgun and had threatened the caller’s husband. When the deputies arrived at the scene and exited their patrol vehicles, they found the subject still sitting on his porch with a shotgun. The deputy used his public address system to direct the subject to put away the gun. The subject instead retreated into the house. The second deputy went to the rear of the patrol vehicle to get a shotgun as the first deputy drew his service weapon. The subject came back outside and the deputy ordered him to hold up his hands and step off the porch. The subject held up his hands and shook his head, before retreating into the house a second time. The deputy was seeking cover near a garage, when the subject fired from inside the residence. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, was hit in the left leg, but managed to take cover at a neighboring residence. The victim deputy advised his partner that he had been hit, and his partner radioed for help as he continued to cover the residence and give commands for the offender to surrender. More officers and emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene. The victim deputy, who survived his wounds and has since returned to duty, was taken to the hospital. The additional officers surrounded the house, and a 3½-hour standoff with the barricaded offender began. The sheriff continued to use a loud speaker to communicate and had a member of the man’s family try to contact him, but the offender did not respond. The man continued to shoot at officers from the back of the residence. He moved to the front of the residence and fired a shotgun at an NCSD sergeant, wounding him in the front of his head (face) and shoulder. The offender shot again at the sergeant, hitting his body armor in the front upper torso/chest area. The sergeant was transported to the hospital, was treated, and survived his wounds. The offender continued to periodically fire towards the officers, and tear gas was introduced into the residence. After an hour with no shooting or movement, the West Virginia State Police used a robot to break a window in an attempt to check the status of the offender. The offender began to shoot again from the front of the residence. Soon after, more tear gas and pepper gas were introduced into the residence. The subject finally exited through the back door. The 84-year-old offender was carrying a shotgun and did not respond to verbal commands to put the weapon down. Instead, he pointed the shotgun at the officers, who justifiably killed him.",1155

"On December 9 at 12:05 p.m., a 48-year-old detective with the Dent County Sheriff’s Department was shot to death while attempting an arrest. Responding to a report of a double homicide at a residence in a rural area of the county, the veteran detective, with 10 years of law enforcement experience, and the sheriff arrived at the suspected killer’s residence. A witness to the murders had identified the man but had provided incorrect information concerning his vehicle. Although the officers did not see the described vehicle at the residence, they approached the home. A woman, later identified as the suspect’s girlfriend, opened the door and spoke to the officers.

The victim officer, who had been wearing body armor, was taken to a local hospital where he died a few hours later from a gunshot wound from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. He had been wounded in his rear lower torso/back below his protective vest. Dispatchers sent out a “be on the lookout” call for the vehicle and accompanying license plate, and the same information was shared with the public. About 10 a.m. the same morning, a man contacted the Oxford Police Department to report a vehicle matching the description, but with no license plate. The caller saw the driver of the vehicle enter a nearby residence. Members of the MSP Fugitive Apprehension Section and the MSP Drug Unit, Worcester Narcotics Unit, began surveillance on the address around 10:30 a.m. Early in the afternoon, members of the MSP Tactical Team positioned an armored response vehicle in front of the address and tried to negotiate with the suspect in an attempt to get him to surrender peacefully. Using infrared technology, the tactical team determined the suspect had tunneled from the residence into an adjacent living space of the duplex, and they believed the man was on the second floor. After 4 hours of attempting to negotiate with the suspect, members of the tactical team entered the duplex and searched for the suspect.

Each officer had a little more than one year of law enforcement experience. The officers were responding to a call for service involving shots fired and an injured person. Upon arrival at the scene, the officers found a single victim with a gunshot wound to the chest. A witness pointed out the residence where officers would find the suspect. The officers saw the suspect in the backyard, about 75 feet away from them. With weapons drawn, the officers ordered the suspect to show his hands. When the suspect turned toward the officers, they saw he was armed with an automatic rifle and was wearing a tactical vest. Without warning, the offender fired at the officers. Both officers, who were wearing body armor, returned fire, but their service weapons malfunctioned (stovepipe jam). Meanwhile, backup units had arrived, and the offender continued to shoot at all the officers on the scene. The officers returned fire, and seven rounds struck the offender justifiably killing him. The 25-year-old officer sustained injuries to his front and rear legs, and the 24-year-old patrol officer was wounded in his front legs and feet. Neither officer has returned to duty at the time this incident was reported to the FBI. The 39-year-old offender’s criminal history included previous arrests and convictions for assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, a weapons violation, and resisting arrest.",1173
"The chief of police of the Ludowici Police Department was killed at 7:30 p.m. on September 15 while answering a call for service for traffic control. The 69-year-old chief, a 23-year veteran of law enforcement, was struck by a vehicle as he attempted to stop traffic and pedestrians from entering a roadway during a vehicle pursuit that began in a nearby county. Deputies from the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office, the Long County Sheriff’s Office, and the Georgia State Police were in pursuit of a vehicle that was headed toward Ludowici at speeds exceeding 100 mph. Deputies had deployed spike strips along the route, and despite the rear driver’s side tire being punctured, the vehicle continued to flee at speeds of 90 to 100 mph. The chief was attempting to clear traffic at the intersection as the vehicle approached. The driver of the vehicle targeted the chief, intentionally hitting him. The vehicle then left the roadway and fatally struck a motorcyclist at an adjacent gasoline station before it came to rest. The driver attempted to flee on foot but was quickly apprehended by state troopers. The chief was transported by ambulance to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The 23-year-old driver was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. He was transported to a hospital, where he was treated and released before being charged with Murder, First-Degree Homicide by Vehicle, Fleeing or Attempting to Elude Police for a Felony Offense, Driving Under the Influence, Speeding, Reckless Driving, Hit and Run Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury, Failure to Report an Accident with Injury or Damage, and Weaving Over the Roadway. He had a criminal history including burglary and a violent crime.",186
"At 8:30 a.m. on December 19, an officer with the Lake City Police Department was shot in a premeditated ambush. The 32-year-old officer, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, and a backup officer responded to a domestic call at a residence. The veteran officer went to the front of the house, and the backup officer went to the rear of the house. As the officer approached the front door, a juvenile female came out; the officer told her to go to a safer area near his squad car. At that point, several gunshots were heard. Two shots went past the female, and one round from a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun struck the officer, who was wearing body armor, at close range in the back of the head. The backup officer heard the gunshots and called to the victim officer with no response. Officers pulled the victim officer from the scene, and he was airlifted to a hospital for treatment. The 25-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included violent crime, committed suicide in the residence. The victim officer succumbed to his injury on December 30.",1152
"A 30-year-old patrol officer with the El Paso Police Department survived injuries he sustained in an ambush with a firearm just before 9 p.m. on October 20. As the officer walked back to his patrol unit after completing a traffic stop, another vehicle pulled up beside the officer and paused. The driver of the vehicle fired four rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, yelled an obscenity at the officer, and drove away. The victim officer, who had nearly 2 years of law enforcement experience, fell to the ground. He used his police radio to advise he had been shot and drew his service weapon in case the offender returned. Several motorists, including the driver of the vehicle the officer had initially pulled over for the traffic stop, rendered first aid to the victim officer. He was hit twice and suffered injuries to his arms/hands and his front upper torso/chest when a round entered between the side panels of his body armor. Law enforcement officials issued a description of the suspect’s vehicle, which was connected to a murder hours later. From that connection, officials determined the identity of the driver who allegedly shot the patrol officer. Around 11 a.m. the following day, law enforcement responded to a call for shots fired behind a local business. There they found a 30-year-old male, who was identified as the suspect, dead from an apparent suicide. The offender had a prior criminal record and was on probation at the time of the incident. Subsequent comparison of the shell casings from the scene of the officer shooting and shell casings from the scene of the offender’s suicide showed a match. At the time this report was written, the victim officer had not returned to duty.",275
"On November 27 at 9:30 p.m., a patrol officer with the Bristol Police Department was killed at a residence to which he was dispatched in response to a domestic disturbance call. According to the report, a man with a gun had been threatening people, including his girlfriend. An unidentified friend of the subject met the 30-year-old officer outside the residence and told him that there was no trouble inside the house. The officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, entered the split- level dwelling and ascended the steps that led to the living area. As he was nearing the top of the stairs, one of the two assisting officers who had just arrived at the scene approached the front door of the residence, glanced up, and saw an arm holding a gun appear from behind the left sidewall at the top of the stairs. The assisting officer saw the subject fire a .357 magnum revolver from his position at the top of the stairs. The fatal shot struck the victim officer in the face. Both assisting officers, who were still outside the dwelling, took cover—one in the front yard and the other behind a vehicle parked in the driveway. Moments later, a man exited the front door, and the officers ordered him to lie on the ground. A second man, who was later identified as the shooter, then exited, and the officers ordered him to lie on the ground. Three women followed, and the officers secured them as well. The alleged assailant, a 26-year-old man, who was on probation from prior criminal charges and who was a known drug dealer, surrendered to the officers without incident. They arrested and charged the man with First- Degree Murder. Other officers entered the house where they found the body of the victim officer at the top of the stairs; they recovered the gun used in the fatal shooting.",933
"On March 3, shortly after 3:30 a.m., a 33-year-old sergeant with the Newark Police Department was killed during a vehicle pursuit. A suspect, who had been arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm, had been placed in the rear of a marked police car with his hands cuffed behind him. The suspect had maneuvered his hands to the front, slipped through the partition to the front seat of the vehicle, and had driven away from the scene. The veteran sergeant obtained another vehicle and pursued the stolen police vehicle. In an attempt to stop the fleeing suspect, the sergeant pulled alongside the man, and the two vehicles made contact. The sergeant’s car careened, then the vehicles collided again, causing the vehicle driven by the sergeant to roll over. The sergeant received wounds to the side and rear of his head, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

"On July 17, a police officer with the Hawaii County Police Department was killed while answering a call for service in Mountain View. At 9:47 p.m., officers began communicating with each other via radio about a wanted suspect possibly parked alongside the highway. While responding to an unrelated call, one officer replied that he had seen a blue sedan parked in the same area with a single occupant in the driver’s seat. Four officers responded to the scene in separate vehicles. Three officers parked behind the suspect vehicle and walked to the rear of it but could not see inside because of the vehicle’s dark window tint. A fourth officer arrived and parked 10 feet in front of the suspect vehicle to illuminate it with his headlights. The officers could clearly see the empty passenger and back seats, but the driver’s seat and headrest were not visible. This led the officers to believe that the seat was fully reclined. One officer knocked on the trunk of the suspect vehicle and saw the driver’s seat pop up with a male sitting inside. Twice, the occupant opened the door about a foot, then closed it while ignoring the officers’ commands to exit the vehicle. Officers could see him moving inside the vehicle but could not tell what he was doing. The driver’s door opened a third time, and officers saw a single hand come up and out of the door. The driver said he was coming out of the vehicle. The 46-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, walked to the driver’s side door, and the suspect immediately fired five rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer in the front below his waist/groin area and fatally in his neck/throat. The other officers returned gunfire, but the suspect fled on foot. Despite a canvass of the area, the suspect remained at large. The victim officer, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 10 years’ experience, died the next day. On July 18, a multijurisdictional task force issued a media release seeking information from the public and began searching for the suspect by contacting confidential sources and informants. Using telephone numbers obtained from confidential sources, investigators narrowed the search to a single phone line and tracked it to the southern point of Hawaii Island. On July 20, the Special Response Team began screening vehicles departing the area. At 2:45 a.m., the team checked a vehicle with a male driver and two female passengers. The officers thought the rear cargo compartment looked staged, with a blanket covering the back and groceries propped up in front of it. Two team members opened the rear hatch, patted the blanket, and noticed movement under it. Suddenly, two rounds were fired from under the blanket in the direction of the officers. One team member fell backward, and the other returned gunfire. Two other team members also returned gunfire. A female emerged from under the blanket with her arms raised, and the body of a male rolled out of the compartment, justifiably killed by the officers’ gunfire. The male was identified as the suspect who had killed the officer 3 days prior. The suspect was 33 years old and was on probation and conditional release pending criminal prosecution at the time of the incident. He was known to possess and use controlled substances, and his criminal history included incarceration and previous arrests for a drug law violation, a weapons violation, other crime of violence, and resisting arrest. Investigators suspect this was a suicide-by-cop incident. The wounded Special Response Team officer sustained a gunshot wound to his front upper torso/chest and has since been released from the hospital.",863
"At 2:32 p.m. on October 20 in Snellville, a 30-year-old senior police officer with the Gwinnett County Police Department was fatally wounded while investigating a report of approximately four suspicious persons who were believed to be smoking drugs in a vehicle. The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, was one of several officers who responded to the call and approached the vehicle to investigate. As officers neared the vehicle, someone from within the vehicle fired six rounds from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The senior police officer was wearing body armor, but he suffered injuries to his arms/hands, front upper torso/chest, front lower torso/abdomen, and, fatally, to his neck/throat. The senior police officer fired four rounds from his duty weapon, and other responding officers fired an additional six rounds, but the suspect fled in the vehicle. Other officers at the scene pulled the injured officer to cover. He was transported to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. Soon afterward, additional officers found the suspect vehicle crashed, and a witness to the crash gave officers a physical description of one of the occupants. Shortly thereafter, officers located a suspect nearby matching the description. When officers attempted to make contact with the suspect, he produced a handgun and attempted to fire at the officers. The officers returned gunfire, but the suspect fled again. During investigation at the first scene, officers discovered blood in multiple areas. A witness gave officers a physical description of a person who was seen running in the area immediately following the incident. The next day, based on information from another witness, officers identified all three of the vehicle’s occupants. Officers attained the necessary arrest warrants, and on October 21, the suspect who fired at officers at the site of the vehicle crash was arrested. The following day, officers acted on a tip about the whereabouts of the other suspect, and they found him hiding in a storage shed of a residence. When officers attempted to take him into custody, he ignored verbal commands and made movements with a lawnmower blade that caused officers to fear for their lives. Officers shot and justifiably killed the suspect. It was later found that the suspect sustained a gunshot wound to his hand at the initial scene of the crime; hence the blood evidence. The 18-year-old suspect was a known or suspected gang member with an arrest history including charges for theft and a drug law violation. At the time of the incident, he was on conditional release pending prosecution and under the influence of marijuana.",688
"A 36-year-old corporal with the South Bend Police Department was fatally wounded around 10:45 p.m. on April 21 during a robbery. The veteran corporal, who had nearly 10 years of law enforcement experience, was off duty and walking across a parking lot with an acquaintance when two young men, one brandishing a weapon, approached them and attempted to rob them. The corporal drew his weapon and ordered them to stop. The two exchanged gunfire; the offender was able to fire six shots with a .38-caliber revolver that struck the corporal in the side of the head, chest, back, and the neck/throat. The veteran corporal was able to fire eight shots, three of which struck the gunman. The accomplice drove the alleged shooter to a local hospital for treatment and upon their arrival, hospital personnel notified police that an individual had been brought there with gunshot wounds. The injured suspect was treated and released from the hospital the next day and was immediately taken into custody. The 18-year-old accomplice was also arrested that day. Neither suspect had prior criminal records. The 17-year-old suspect was charged with Felony Murder and Robbery, and the 18-year-old accomplice was charged with Murder and Attempted Robbery. The victim corporal was taken to a local hospital, but he slipped into a coma and died of the injuries to his neck/throat on April 23.",338
"A 29-year-old patrol officer with the El Paso Police Department was attacked while in an off-duty capacity on September 25. Just before 5 p.m., the officer noticed three unknown suspects vandalizing his personal vehicle, which was parked in front of his residence. One of the suspects scratched the vehicle with a piece of metal as he walked by. The officer exited his residence to confront the suspect about damaging the vehicle. The three suspects ignored the officer, so he got in his vehicle and followed them. The officer, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, exited his vehicle, identified himself as a law enforcement officer, and attempted to begin an investigation of the vandalism. One of the suspects, a 17-year-old with a prior criminal record, stepped in the middle of the conversation and struck the officer in the face with his fist. The suspect then grabbed the officer around his knees and caused him to fall to the ground and hit his head on the concrete. Though the officer was unconscious, the suspect beat the victim officer multiple times in the face and head, and then the suspects fled. The victim officer suffered a fractured skull, hemorrhaging, and multiple facial fractures due to injuries obtained to the front, side, and rear of his head. The victim officer succumbed to his injuries 10 days later on October 5. The suspect was charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer and Evading Arrest/Detention.",262
"On April 24, at 7:50 p.m., an officer with the Department of Veterans Affairs in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was shot to death in an ambush while he attended his post at the back gate of the Veteran’s Hospital in Rio Piedras. A video from the hospital’s security system showed that the 53-year-old officer, who had 23 years of law enforcement experience, was approached by two individuals while he was performing his duties in the guard station. When the officer noticed the individuals, they were already very close to the guard house. A struggle ensued, and one of the assailants shot the victim officer with a .38-caliber handgun at point blank range. One bullet struck the officer in his chest and a second shot wounded him fatally in the side of his head. Investigating officers believe that the suspects were attempting to steal the victim officer’s service revolver, but they were unsuccessful. The unidentified assailants, who remain at large at time of publication, were also seen fleeing from the scene after the murder of the officer.",788
"A 48-year-old patrol officer with the Saginaw Township Police Department was severely injured during a traffic stop on January 22 at 2:09 a.m. in Kochville Township. The officer, a veteran with nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a vehicle because the driver was not using headlights. Unknown to the officer, the driver had stolen the vehicle less than an hour earlier. The driver was wanted for escaping from a tether program and had multiple felony warrants for earlier motor vehicle and handgun thefts. Footage from the officer’s in-car dash camera showed the officer exited his patrol vehicle and approached the vehicle on the driver’s side. As the officer began speaking, the driver lifted a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun (which he had stolen 7 days earlier) from his lap where it was concealed. He thrust it at the officer’s face and fired two rounds. The first round struck the front of the officer’s head at close range, and the second struck his shoulder (upper torso) area outside the protective panel of his body armor. The offender immediately began to speed away as the officer drew his service weapon and fired two rounds, striking the tailgate of the stolen vehicle. The officer radioed dispatch and reported he’d been shot and gave a description of the suspect’s vehicle. A manhunt ensued until later that day when a detective with the Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Department located the offender on a roadway in another stolen vehicle. The offender suddenly stopped the car, got out, and pointed a firearm at the detective. The detective fired multiple rounds, striking the offender in the chest and face. The 29-year-old offender was arrested and charged with one count each of Attempted Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer, Felony Firearms Violation, Unlawful Driving Away in an Automobile, and Escape. His criminal history included charges for aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest, and a sex offense.

"A 25-year-old officer with the Marion Police Department was shot and killed following a felony traffic pursuit at 9:15 a.m. on March 5. The officer, who had 1 year of law enforcement experience, was responding to a call from a teller at the drive-through window of an area bank. Three males, aged 16, 22, and 23, in a pickup truck had attempted to cash a forged check at the bank. As the officer approached the bank, the 16-year-old driver sped away, and the officer followed. After a chase that lasted several minutes and approached speeds of 100 miles per hour, the driver lost control of the truck, which was later determined to have been stolen, and crashed into a ditch. The trio exited the truck through the passenger-side door. The officer stopped, exited his vehicle, and chased the driver, who was the last to exit the vehicle, into a wooded area. As the officer neared the 16-year-old, the teenager apparently turned and fired shots at close range from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The first shot hit the officer in the chest and he dropped to his knees; a second and fatal shot hit him in his forehead. The driver was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder and Aggravated Flight from Officer.

"A 39-year-old sergeant with the Keokuk County Sheriff’s Department was shot and killed in Sigourney on April 4 during a tactical situation involving a suspect reported to have mental problems and exhibiting violent and criminal behavior. The sergeant, a veteran of 11 years of law enforcement, met with the sheriff and chief deputy to discuss the situation before going to the suspect’s residence. The officers contacted the suspect to let him know they were approaching the house. Around 11:30 a.m., the sheriff approached the residence and asked the suspect to come out and talk. After no response, the sheriff returned to the two patrol vehicles and the chief deputy and sergeant. As the sheriff walked up to the vehicles, the sergeant called out “Gun!” Gunfire immediately followed. The sheriff, chief deputy, and sergeant took cover behind the farthest patrol vehicle. They assessed the situation and determined that the shots all came from the residence, but they could not locate the suspect. Responding units were told to remain at a distance for safety. The three officers, trapped behind the disabled patrol vehicles, fired suppression rounds at the house but could not retreat because of the lack of tactical cover. Although they were running out of ammunition, the officers decided they had to remain in place for the protection of the responding officers and the community at large. During a lull in gunfire, the suspect exited undetected from an unobserved area of the house. The suspect engaged in a close-range gunfire battle with the chief deputy as the sheriff and sergeant rotated around the vehicle for a better field of vision. During the tactical move, the sergeant, who was wearing body armor, was fatally shot in the head by the suspect with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. The sheriff then returned fire on the suspect, who briefly stopped shooting in order to take cover. Seeing that the sergeant was fatally wounded and that they were nearly without ammunition, the sheriff and chief deputy retreated under heavy fire. Shortly after, the Iowa State Patrol sniper/tactical team arrived and attempted negotiations over the telephone. The 53-year-old suspect, who had a criminal history including weapons violations, stated he would kill any officer who came to the house.

The 32-year-old officer, a 7-year veteran of law enforcement, was off duty and at the restaurant when a man created a disturbance. The man was removed from the restaurant, and management asked him not to return for the evening. The officer was aware of the incident but did not act in an official capacity. A short time later, the man returned to the restaurant with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. He brandished the weapon and stated he was armed. Patrons alerted the officer to the situation. Now acting in an official capacity, the officer immediately approached the man and attempted to defuse the situation. During the encounter, the man began discharging his weapon as the officer was forcing him out the door. The offender shot the officer at close range in the front upper torso/chest, and fatally in the front lower torso/stomach area.

"On January 4, a 30-year-old master officer with the Ogden Police Department (OPD) was shot during a tactical situation around 8:40 in the evening, and succumbed to his injuries the next day. Five other law enforcement officers were shot during the same incident in which the suspect ambushed the officers. The officers, who were serving a drug-related warrant as part of the Weber-Morgan Narcotics Strike Force, identified themselves as law enforcement and entered the suspect’s residence with a search warrant. An OPD master officer, a 36-year-old veteran of law enforcement with more than 14 years of experience, was attempting to clear a bathroom when the suspect shot the officer, wounding him in the side of the head with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun.

"A 24-year-old deputy sheriff with the Oneida County Sheriff’s Office (OCSO) was killed around 2 a.m. on June 7 during a tactical situation in response to a domestic dispute. At 9:45 p.m. on June 6, OCSO law enforcement officers were dispatched to a residence in Munnsville, where an individual armed with a shotgun was barricaded. The OCSO’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) and crisis negotiators initiated dialogue with the armed individual. After failed negotiations, the ERT used non-lethal ammunition in an attempt to subdue the subject who was in the garage area of the residence. As the deputy attempted to deploy an electronic control device to further incapacitate him, the subject retained control of the 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and fired at least two rounds. One round struck the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the throat. Other law enforcement personnel at the scene returned fire, striking the subject multiple times.

"A 41-year-old police officer with the Walker Police Department (WPD) was struck and killed during a traffic pursuit while attempting to stop two bank robbery suspects on October 13 just after 11 a.m. Earlier that morning, two suspects robbed a bank in nearby Ravenna and fled in an SUV. Officers of the Muskegon County Sheriff’s Department, the Michigan State Police, the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Department, the WPD, and the FBI pursued the suspects into Ottawa County. As the chase continued, the suspects drove westbound on an interstate at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, firing a rifle at the pursuing cruisers and posing a serious threat to other motorists. In an effort to stop the dangerous high-speed chase, the WPD officer, a law enforcement veteran of nearly 17 years, parked his cruiser at a highway exit in Wright Township and left the vehicle to position a tire-deflation device in the roadway. As the suspects left the interstate, the officer, who was wearing body armor, ran from the approaching vehicle, but the driver swerved to hit him. The impact caused multiple injuries to the officer, resulting in his immediate death. The vehicle crashed, and the 36-year-old driver fled on foot with officers in pursuit. While continuing to fire on the officers and ignoring commands to drop his rifle, the driver was shot by return fire and justifiably killed at the scene. The 32-year-old suspect who was a passenger in the vehicle remained in the back seat firing his rifle at arriving officers.

"Around 10:45 a.m. on June 28, a 38-year-old sergeant with the Hood County Sheriff’s Office (HCSO) was fatally wounded while responding to a disturbance call. Approximately 10:30 a.m., the HCSO dispatched units to a residence in Granbury. A suspect awaiting trial on sexual assault charges was outside of the residence of his alleged victim. A protective order had previously been filed against the suspect, and the owner of the residence contacted the sheriff’s office for assistance. The veteran sergeant, who had nearly 7 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene first. He exited his vehicle and ordered the man to come to the patrol unit. When the suspect reached the vehicle, he produced a .45 caliber revolver and shot the sergeant, who was wearing body armor, in the rear and side of his head. The suspect then fired at the alleged victim’s family members standing on the front porch of the residence. The home owner retrieved his firearm from inside the residence and fired at the suspect as he drove away in his van, shattering at least one of the van’s windows. A deputy arrived at the scene and found several people gathered around the sergeant’s vehicle. A man approached the deputy and told him that the sergeant had been shot. The deputy located the sergeant lying on the ground unconscious, but breathing, and requested an ambulance. The people gathered there provided the deputy with the name of the suspect and a description of his van. The deputy relayed the descriptive information over the radio to local law enforcement. The sheriff and a lieutenant with the HCSO were in a marked vehicle headed toward the scene when they noticed a van matching the description of the suspect’s vehicle headed in the opposite direction. They turned around and activated their vehicle’s lights and sirens. Before they caught up to the van, units with the Granbury Police Department and Texas Highway Patrol also pulled behind the van with their lights and sirens activated. The sheriff and lieutenant were followed by another police vehicle driven by a deputy from Hood County. The suspect continued onto a street that led to the city hall parking lot, where he parked the van. The officers stopped and exited their vehicles, each using their vehicle or a nearby concrete wall for cover. The suspect exited the van and began firing at the officers with a rifle. Officers returned gunfire, but from the suspect’s reaction, it appeared to the sheriff that he was wearing protective gear. The sheriff shot the suspect in the head, and he fell to the ground. The 49-year-old offender died at the scene. He was under supervision at the time of the incident and had a criminal record that included violent crime. The victim sergeant was transported by ambulance to a local hospital, where he died the next day from the wound to the side of his head.",622

Based on their initial observations, the officers concluded that the suspect had left the area, and they began processing the scene. As one of the officers advanced toward the door of the suspect's RV, a man shot her from inside with 12-gauge shotgun. The victim officer fell wounded just a few feet from the RV's front door. The assisting officer, who was processing the scene nearby, called for additional units when he heard the shot. He sought out the source of the gunshot and found the victim officer near the  RV door. The officer saw the offender holding a shotgun inside the RV and alerted dispatch. Assisting officers arrived on scene and surrounded the RV. The offender had barricaded himself inside and would not respond to communication efforts. Due to their uncertainty regarding the victim officer's medical condition and their inability to remove her from the scene safely, officers decided to shoot the offender. Officers and the offender exchanged gunfire for several seconds, and then a cease-fire was called. Shortly after, the offender fired at an officer positioned  next to a neighboring RV, striking the officer with multiple rounds in his left arm, side, and back.

While the officer was doing this, the first suspect moved in from behind the officer and struck him in the face. The officer released his grip on the second individual, a struggle ensued, and the officer and first suspect fell to the floor. The officer reported that his gun fell out of his holster, and while he and the first suspect were struggling for possession of the gun, the officer was shot in the rear lower torso/back with a .38-caliber revolver by the second suspect, a 16-year-old male who was later determined to be under the influence of narcotics and alcohol. Both suspects fled the store on foot, but were tracked to one of the suspect’s residence where they hid in the attic. SWAT officers were summoned, and after tear gas was shot into the attic, both suspects surrendered. The shooter was tried as an adult, found guilty, and sentenced to 25 years in a correctional facility. The first suspect was tried as a juvenile and sentenced to the Ohio Youth Commission. The victim officer was retired from the Columbus Division of Police on disability and struggled with health consequences, including permanent paralysis below the waist. An autopsy confirmed that his death was a direct result of complications from his injuries.",486
"Shortly before 9:30 a.m. on July 5, a 45-year-old deputy sheriff with the Wright County Sheriff’s Office was wounded while attempting to execute a warrant for the sale/manufacture of a controlled substance at a residence in Norwood. The veteran deputy, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, and accompanying officers encountered a barricade the subject had placed in the road leading to the residence that forced them to approach on foot. The deputy and officers noticed the subject washing a vehicle at the residence as they approached. The subject heard the officers coming and, without warning, opened fire with an illegally modified .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun he produced from his waistband. One round struck the victim deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the front leg from 21 feet away. The deputy and officers returned fire, justifiably striking the offender multiple times. The offender did not seek cover and continued to fire at the officers until he succumbed to his injuries. The 58-year-old offender was on probation at the time of the incident, was known to possess a controlled substance, and had prior arrests for a drug law violation. The offender’s family suspected the incident was a suicide by cop based on comments the suspect had made about never going back to prison.",184
"Shortly after 5 a.m. on July 2, a 29-year-old trooper with the New York State Police (NYSP) was fatally injured during a tactical situation following a check on the welfare of a subject. Around 3 a.m., NYSP troopers responded to a residence in Erwin where a subject was threatening to shoot himself. The troopers checked the home, found nothing unusual, and departed. A short time later, the troopers located the subject as he was driving back toward the residence. They followed the subject and witnessed him entering the house. The troopers attempted to communicate with the subject but got no response. The trooper, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner arrived at the residence along with deputies from the Steuben County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO); they took up perimeter positions outside the home. Around 4:45 a.m., the subject broke a window from the rear of the house and fired at the troopers with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. A buckshot round struck the trooper, who was wearing body armor, in the front upper torso/chest, the arms/hands, the front legs/feet, and fatally in the front of his head. An SCSO deputy returned gunfire toward the rear of the house but missed the subject. The subject exited the front of the residence and encountered an NYSP negotiator and a trooper. The officers fired 18 rounds from their service weapons at the subject, causing him to retreat into the house. The NYSP Special Operations Response Team and the SCSO SWAT team arrived and entered the home. They discovered the 42-year-old subject, who had no prior arrests or judicial history, had committed suicide. Investigators suspected the incident may have been a case of suicide-by- cop. A postmortem examination revealed one round from law enforcement struck the subject in the torso causing an injury that may have been fatal had the subject not shot himself in the moments after he was justifiably shot by law enforcement.",983
"Approximately 3 a.m. on August 6, a 39-year-old deputy sheriff with the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed when he responded to a burglary in progress. The deputy, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence located in the community of Smoaks. The deputy was approaching the house via the carport when he suddenly was confronted by two suspects exiting the home through a kitchen door that led onto the same carport. One of the suspects fired two shots at the deputy from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, and one of the shots struck the victim deputy in the lower abdomen, just below his protective vest. The victim deputy died at the scene. The burglars fled the area before additional deputies arrived. In the ensuing investigation, officers arrested two suspects on September 5. The first suspect, a 19-yearold male with a prior criminal history, was charged with Murder, 4 counts of First-] Degree Burglary, and 1 count of Second-Degree Burglary. The second suspect, an 18-year-old male who was on probation at the time of the incident, was also charged with Murder, 3 counts of First-Degree Burglary, and Second-Degree Burglary. A 16-year veteran of law enforcement was killed at 1:35 a.m. on May 3 while attempting an arrest in Holly Hill. The 46-year-old corporal with the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office had been dispatched to escort a woman in retrieving her belongings from her home following a domestic altercation with her husband. On the way to the residence, the corporal was notified that there was an active warrant for failure to appear for the woman’s husband. The woman, her sister, and the corporal arrived at the home in two separate cars. A visitor answered the door, and the corporal told the visitor why he was there. As the women retrieved the belongings, a man from a nearby residence, who was dressed only in boxer shorts, approached the corporal. Witnesses confirmed to the corporal that the man was the woman’s husband. The corporal told the man to put on some clothes and that the corporal had a warrant for his arrest. The husband asked if he could talk to his wife, but the corporal denied his request and again told the man to put on some clothes. The man entered the home to dress. In the meantime, the women had finished gathering the possessions and were waiting in their car for the corporal, who was on the front porch talking to witnesses with his back partially to the door of the home. As the man approached, the corporal, who was wearing body armor, began to turn. The man fired a single shot at close range from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, fatally striking the corporal in the neck. The man then jumped off the front porch of the home and attempted to shoot his wife, who was in the passenger side of the car. Her sister, who was driving, tried to escape the man. She put the car in reverse and accelerated as she tried to leave the area; in doing so, she unknowingly struck the man and another witness who was attempting to tackle him. The women called 911 and reported the incident. Additional units arrived, and officers discovered the victim corporal on the ground in front of the porch. Emergency personnel declared the corporal dead on the scene. Officers located the 41-year-old man in a ditch dead from injuries he sustained from being struck by the car. The man, who had prior convictions for violent crime, was under the influence of narcotics and was on conditional release at the time of the incident.",614
"At 9:56 p.m. on February 24, a 34-year-old deputy sheriff with the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office was injured by gunfire while investigating suspicious persons or circumstances in Alexandria. The veteran deputy, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a call from a homeowner who reported a vehicle had been parked in their driveway for an unusually long period of time. The officer arrived at the residence and pulled his squad car into the driveway behind the suspicious vehicle. The temperature was below zero, and the driveway was icy and lined with 1 to 2 feet of snow. The deputy observed the vehicle had a dealer license plate and relayed this information to dispatchers. After exiting his squad car, the deputy, who was wearing body armor, approached the suspicious vehicle and spoke with two occupants, a male in the driver’s seat and a female in the passenger’s seat. Both occupants claimed to have no identification with them, but they provided the deputy with their full names and dates of birth. The deputy went back to his squad car and searched the names via his computer; he located the female’s driver’s license information but not the male’s. As he returned to the vehicle, the deputy noticed the driver’s side window was rolled almost completely down, and the man had repositioned himself with his upper torso twisted and parallel to the driver’s side door. The deputy thought the change in position was unusual; however, he reasoned that the driver may be attempting to stay warm. As the deputy talked to the occupants while at the driver’s window, he saw a flash and realized he had been shot. The male driver had fired a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and struck the victim deputy in his front upper torso/chest. The deputy immediately retreated to his squad car while returning fire. The suspect started moving his vehicle down the driveway toward the complainant’s residence but veered to the side and got stuck in the snow. After reaching his squad car, the deputy backed the vehicle to the end of the driveway and over the road, where he also got hung up in the snow. The deputy continued to see flashes coming from the suspect’s vehicle and heard what he believed to be rounds striking the trees behind him. At this time, the victim deputy retrieved his rifle but did not fire because he did not have a clear target. He also radioed dispatchers and advised he had been shot and requested backup. Shortly thereafter, deputies and officers from the surrounding area arrived, but they could not immediately locate the suspect or his female passenger. It was later verified that after the suspect’s vehicle got stuck in the snow, the suspect fired more rounds at the deputy before he and the woman left their vehicle and tried to enter the complainant’s residence. However, when the homeowners brandished their own firearms, the subjects ran away. Hours later, responders in a helicopter and SWAT teams found the suspects several hundred yards from the residence, both dead from gunshot wounds. Further investigation revealed the man had first killed the woman, who was later found to be his girlfriend, then turned the gun on himself in an apparent murder-suicide. None of the rounds fired by the victim officer had hit the subjects. Toxicology reports on the man and woman revealed that they were both under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. The 24-year-old male suspect had a prior criminal record, including drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. It was later learned the two subjects had been involved in numerous other crimes in the previous 48 hours, including the burglary of a veterinary hospital where controlled substances were stolen. The wounded deputy recovered from his injuries and has returned to duty.",1154
"On December 29 at 9:15 p.m., a patrol officer with the Pendergrass Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to make a traffic stop. The 45-year-old officer tried to stop two males in a vehicle for a traffic violation. Instead of stopping, the driver of the vehicle sped away and a short chase ensued. In the course of the chase, the vehicle crashed into a ditch. The 14-year veteran officer exited his police cruiser and approached the disabled vehicle. The driver, who had gotten out of his car, began shooting at the officer from the ditch with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The officer was wounded several times: in the front upper torso, in the front lower torso below his protective vest, and, fatally, in the head. The driver fled the scene of the shooting on foot. The passenger, still in the vehicle, was apprehended at the scene by arriving officers from the Pendergrass Police Department and deputies from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department. The victim officer died at the scene. The responding officers located the driver a short time later in a nearby field, wounded from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. The 26-year-old driver, who was under supervision and on conditional release at the time of the shooting, and the 18-year-old passenger were both charged with Murder. Subsequently, the passenger agreed to testify on behalf of the government; he was finally charged with Conspiracy to Commit a Burglary and Possession of Tools for Commission of a Crime.",821
"On May 24, just after 5:30 a.m., a police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department (Poughkeepsie PD) was assaulted and injured while answering a disturbance call. The 36-year-old veteran officer had more than 7 years of police experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident. She was flagged down by a passing motorist who reported that a man was screaming at cars and blocking traffic several blocks away. At the same time, another Poughkeepsie PD officer was dispatched to the area for the same disturbance. He arrived first, and the man immediately confronted the officer while he was still in his vehicle. The officer pulled his patrol vehicle away from the man to create some distance. At that time, the officer who had been flagged down arrived and opened the door to exit her patrol vehicle, but the man ran at her before she could get out. He began slashing her with a box cutter, wounding her on the front of her head, her neck/throat, and on her arms/hands. The victim officer unsuccessfully attempted to fire her electronic control device. The other officer on the scene witnessed the situation and drew his duty weapon. The offender persisted, who was now on top of the victim officer in her patrol vehicle. The officer fired his weapon. The offender then pulled the victim officer out of her vehicle, and both fell to the ground where he continued his assault. The victim officer’s patrol vehicle was still in gear and rolled past her as she struggled with the offender on the ground. The other officer continued firing at the suspect until his service weapon was empty. The offender was wounded, and the victim officer, though injured, freed herself from under him. She got to her feet and managed to stop her rolling patrol vehicle. After securing it, the victim officer exited the vehicle and collapsed on the curb. Bystanders provided assistance. The suspect, who was under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time, rolled onto his back and continued the slashing motion with the box cutter. The officer returned his weapon to his holster and handcuffed the suspect. The entire incident was recorded by multiple cameras in the area. The 27-year-old assailant, who later died of the gunshot wounds, had no prior criminal record.",916
"On March 18 at 10:30 p.m., a 43-year-old sergeant with the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed at a hair salon in Baton Rouge during a rape investigation. The veteran sergeant, who had nearly 16 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner, a lieutenant, were investigating the suspected rapist and found him at the salon. The subject pulled out a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, and a physical encounter ensued. During the struggle, the subject shot the sergeant at close range in the rear lower torso/back and fatally in the rear upper torso/back. The lieutenant fired four rounds at the subject, all of which struck him, then secured him with handcuffs and called for assistance. Both the sergeant and the subject were transported to local hospitals. The sergeant was pronounced dead at the hospital. The 30-year-old subject died from his wounds on March 21. Investigators suspect this was an incidence of suicide-by-cop. The subject had a criminal history that included a weapons violation, a drug law violation, and sex crimes.",153
