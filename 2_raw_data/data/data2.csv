"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault. The suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, turned the handgun on himself and committed suicide. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The K-9 survived its injury.",954
"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290
"A 30-year-old patrol officer with the Sandusky Police Department was shot and killed on March 19 while attempting to make a traffic stop. Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was treated at a nearby hospital, but died from the wound to his upper back from a round that entered through the armhole of his vest.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence. After a standoff of several hours, SWAT officers arrested the alleged shooter without further incident. He was charged with Murder.",196
"On August 12 around 3:40 p.m., a 33-year-old patrol officer with the Hatch Police Department was fatally wounded while making a traffic stop. The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects. The 38-year-old man who allegedly shot the victim officer was charged with Murder, Possession of a Firearm, Firing Weapon, and Carjacking. He was under the influence of narcotics and on probation at the time of the incidents and had a prior criminal record which included a murder. The victim officer was airlifted to a nearby hospital where he died later that day.",798
"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene. Following the suicide, investigators discovered the suspect had killed his estranged wife as she sat in her vehicle before the officers had arrived. He had a previous criminal record that included drug violations, violent crime, and weapons violations.",1124
"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest. The deputy was able to fire four rounds from his service weapon, but none of the rounds struck the suspect. Another officer then shot the suspect in the head, killing him instantly. The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The suspect was subsequently found unconscious in his jail cell and later died. The cause of death had not been determined at the time of this report.",624
"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31. The deceased offender was later found to have marijuana and cocaine in a bag tied to his belt and concealed in his clothes.

During the stop, it was discovered that the driver had an expired registration and no insurance for the vehicle. The second officer, a 21-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived to assist. After both officers decided to impound the vehicle, they approached the vehicle and asked the driver to exit. The driver emerged from the vehicle with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and immediately shot the first officer, who was wearing body armor, in the front below the waist. The driver then fired at the second officer, striking him in the right hand. When the second officer fell to the ground, the driver turned back to the first officer who lay wounded on the ground and shot him in the side of the head, killing him. The second officer exchanged gunfire with the shooter with his left hand, then retreated to a safe area and called for assistance. The suspect fled to his residence nearby. Within an hour, law enforcement officers had set up a perimeter around the house. After several hours, a police tactical team deployed tear gas into the home. The 58-year-old suspect fired a round from the window before officers saw him exit the rear door of the house armed with a shotgun. A tactical team sniper justifiably shot and killed him.",1101
"A corporal from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed on December 8 at 9:15 a.m. while responding to a disturbance call in Williamston. The 38-year-old veteran corporal, who had nearly 16 years of law enforcement service, responded to a report that a man was walking around and firing a gun in a residential area in the city. When the corporal arrived at the alleged shooter’s residence, he saw a man was inside the home. The corporal had a brief conversation with the man from the front porch and then immediately requested that all available officers report to the scene. The man appeared to walk to the rear interior of the home, and the corporal walked to the side of the house, approaching the backyard. In the backyard, the corporal encountered the man holding a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. The corporal ordered the man to drop his weapon; instead, the man fired an unknown number of shots, striking the corporal in the front upper torso/chest.

"On October 29, just before 11 p.m., a 33-year-old deputy sheriff with the Rusk County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed in an ambush (entrapment and premeditation) in Conrath. The veteran deputy, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, noticed a vehicle driving erratically in a field of crops. The deputy drove his patrol unit into the field and attempted to contact the driver of the vehicle. As the deputy approached, the suspect drove further into the crops. The deputy activated his patrol unit’s overhead lights and radioed for backup. The vehicle was approximately 160 yards away when the driver turned it around and faced the deputy’s patrol unit. Without warning, the driver fired six rounds from a .25-06 bolt-action rifle at the deputy. All six rounds hit the deputy’s patrol unit. One of the rounds entered the vehicle and fatally struck the deputy in the front of his head. Another round exceeded the specifications of the deputy’s body armor and hit him in the front lower torso/stomach. Unable to reach the victim deputy on the radio, dispatchers called for backup. The responding deputies arrived at the field and located the victim deputy in his patrol unit. Before the deputies could extract him, the suspect began shooting at them from his nearby residence. The deputies retreated and waited for the SWAT team to arrive. When the SWAT officers arrived, they removed the victim deputy from his patrol unit. During the ensuing 12-hour standoff, the suspect occasionally fired upon the SWAT officers. Eventually, the SWAT officers took the 43-year-old suspect into custody. The suspect, a known drug possessor and user, was under the influence of narcotics and was on probation at the time of the incident. He had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, drug law violation, and an assaulting an officer/resisting arrest charge.

"On July 6, officers from the Michigan State Police (MSP) and the Newaygo County Sheriff’s Department attempted to serve an arrest warrant on a man who was accused of accosting children for immoral purposes. Officers from both agencies approached the suspect at the front door of his residence, but the man retreated inside the house, warning the officers that he was armed. The suspect, who was known to be a member of a local militia, barricaded himself inside the residence. The officers established a perimeter and called for assistance from the MSP’s Emergency Support Team. When the team arrived, they attempted to convince the suspect to surrender. The man refused, and the negotiations continued into the next day. Approximately 12 hours after negotiations began, one of the officers attempted to provide the man with a telephone; however, he began firing at the officers from inside the residence. The officers stopped negotiations at this point, and the MSP’s Emergency Support Team introduced chemical agents (tear gas) into the residence through windows on all four sides of the house. On July 7 about 3 p.m. and approximately 15 minutes after introducing the tear gas into the house, an eight-man MSP entry team, armed with ballistic shields, handguns, and other weapons, introduced a diversionary device into the residence and attempted to enter the house from the back door. As soon as the first four officers, who were wearing ballistic vests, helmets, and gas masks, entered through the door, they encountered a barrage of gunfire from the suspect, but they were unable to establish the shooter’s exact location. The remaining four members of the team were unable to enter because of the gunfire. When the four officers entered the dwelling, a 33-year-old trooper, who had more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, was struck in his right forearm. The victim officer dropped his weapon and the ballistic shield he was carrying and turned toward the direction of the gunfire. He was then shot in the rear lower and rear upper torso. One of the bullets passed through his protective vest and the other one struck him below the vest. The veteran trooper was also shot in the rear portion of the upper left leg, sustaining a total of four gunshot wounds. One of the officers fired a round at the shooter, but his gun jammed. During the gunfire, the officer with the malfunctioning firearm recovered the victim trooper and moved him toward safety while the remaining two team members covered them. The third officer, who was also carrying a shield, fired 13 rounds at the assailant, and the fourth officer fired 6 rounds as the first officer pulled the victim to safety through the back door. The exchange of gunfire lasted approximately 15 to 20 seconds. It was unknown at the time whether the shooter was injured during the exchange. After the four officers were outside and under cover, the victim officer was taken by an ambulance to a local hospital where he died a short time later from the wound in his upper back. One of the other three officers sustained a superficial gunshot wound to his shoulder for which he was treated; he returned to duty that same day. After examining the crime scene later, the officers believed that the shooter had been hiding between a wood burning stove and a large steel tool box approximately 6 to10 feet from the door. After the shooting incident, the MSP maintained a perimeter around the residence. Over the next 24 hours, they attempted to reestablish contact with the assailant but were unsuccessful. On July 8, at 4 p.m., the officers introduced several satchel charges that started a fire inside the dwelling. The structure burned to the ground, and after the fire was under control, the officers searched for the subject. The officers found several weapons, including the victim trooper’s handgun, but the suspect had managed to flee from the scene. The MSP and local law enforcement investigated many leads over the next several days in an attempt to locate the assailant. On July 13, officers found the suspect sleeping in a parked car at a residence near his house. The officers approached the man and ordered him to remain inside the vehicle and show his hands. However, the suspect, who had no prior history beyond traffic citations, exited the vehicle with a rifle pointed at the arresting officers. The officers shot and killed the 40-year-old man. The officers recovered at the scene the .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle believed to have been the one used to kill the victim trooper. An autopsy of the assailant revealed that all of his wounds were fresh. The investigators concluded that the suspect had not been injured during the exchange of gunfire with the MSP’s Emergency Support Team on July 7.",878
"A deputy with the Randolph County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed during an attempted arrest shortly before 2 p.m. on April 27. The 41- year-old deputy with almost 4 years of law enforcement experience went to a residence with a deputy trainee to serve a domestic violence warrant. Wanting to obtain clothes and other items from the house, the wife of the man being served papers also accompanied the deputy. When they arrived at the house, the deputy and the wife went to the front door and the deputy trainee went to the back of the residence. The deputy knocked on the door. When no one answered, the deputy obtained the key from the wife and opened the door. The woman’s husband confronted the deputy, and the two struggled for control of the deputy’s .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Responding to a shout for assistance from the deputy, the deputy trainee ran to the front of the house and saw the two men struggling. Not realizing that they were fighting for control of the deputy’s gun, the deputy trainee tried to grab one of the man’s arms, but the man was able to gain control of the gun and pull away. He then fired three shots at the deputy, who was struck in the stomach, the neck, and fatally in the chest. The man then turned the gun toward the deputy trainee and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. The deputy trainee ran to the patrol car and took cover behind it. The man ran to a car parked in front of the patrol car and took a position behind it. In an exchange of gunfire, the man shot the deputy trainee in the left arm and then returned to the residence. The deputy trainee entered his patrol car and called for assistance. When officers arrived at the scene, the suspect surrendered.

The 37-year-old sergeant, who was a 12-year veteran of law enforcement, returned home from work and parked his car in the driveway. He exited his vehicle and opened the back door on the driver’s side when he was shot in the back by a person with a .223-caliber rifle. Although the sergeant was wearing protective armor, the bullet penetrated his vest (body armor failure). The sergeant was then shot in the neck, side of the head, and back of the head, which proved to be the fatal wound, by a man with a shotgun, for which no description was available at the time of this publication.

He was charged with First-Degree Murder, Armed Criminal Action, and Felony Leaving the Scene of an Accident, in connection with the sergeant’s death.",696
"Around 11:45 a.m. on February 19, a 48-year-old police officer with the Bay City Department of Public Safety (BCDPS) was shot and wounded while assisting in a tactical situation. Earlier that morning, a BCDPS task force learned a subject had violated his conditional release bond the previous day. Around 10 a.m., three BCDPS officers in unmarked vehicles began physical surveillance of the suspect’s residence. At approximately 10:30 a.m., the suspect came outside the residence to greet a male visitor. The man and the suspect both entered the residence. Slightly more than an hour later, the officers saw the man and the suspect leave the residence. Both men got into their vehicles, the man drove away first, and seconds later the suspect followed. Both vehicles turned onto another street, where a uniformed BCDPS officer in a fully marked patrol unit was positioned to enact a traffic stop on the suspect. One of the plainclothes officers joined the uniformed officer at the side of the road, where the uniformed officer ordered the suspect to exit his vehicle. However, the suspect disregarded the order and sped away. The two officers ran back to the marked patrol unit, and a vehicle chase ensued. The officer in the passenger’s seat notified dispatch of the pursuit, as the suspect led the officers back to his residence. The suspect parked his vehicle in his driveway, jumped out, and ran toward a basement window on the north side of the house. The plainclothes officer exited the patrol unit and continued the chase on foot. When the suspect reached the basement window, he broke the glass and attempted to dive inside. However, he got stuck halfway through the opening with his right arm and right leg still outside the window. The officer grabbed the suspect’s arm and attempted to pull him back outside. During the struggle, the uniformed officer arrived to assist. When the suspect’s arm slipped from the plainclothes officer’s grasp, the suspect fell into the basement, and the officer stumbled backward. The uniformed officer covered the window and ordered the suspect to come out. The plainclothes officer then ran back to the patrol unit, which was parked in the driveway, to turn off the vehicle’s siren. As he was running, he heard a single gunshot coming from the basement. After turning off the siren and starting back toward the basement window, the officer heard several more gunshots coming from the west side of the residence. He took cover at the corner of the street and saw that the uniformed officer had taken cover behind the front wheel located on the driver’s side of the patrol unit. He then noticed another one of the plainclothes officers had arrived to assist and had been struck in the rear lower torso/back with a round from the suspect’s 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded police officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 22 years of experience, had taken cover behind the rear wheel located on the driver’s side of his unmarked vehicle. Both the uniformed officer and the wounded plainclothes officer were trapped behind their vehicles with no escape routes from the suspect who had barricaded himself inside the residence. At that time, four additional BCDPS officers arrived on the scene. The initial plainclothes officer obtained a department-issued AR-15 rifle from the arriving officers and positioned himself to cover the officers who were still unable to move from their locations. Officers from other local agencies and the Michigan State Police Emergency Support Team also responded to assist. The suspect committed suicide several hours later. The 38-year-old man, who was known by law enforcement to deal drugs, had a prior criminal record including charges for a police assault, weapons violation, and drug law violation.

"A 43-year-old police officer with the San Diego Police Department (SDPD) was killed and a 32-year-old police officer with the SDPD was wounded shortly before 11 p.m. on July 28, while investigating a suspicious person. The pair were in their patrol unit when they saw two males in the middle of a street walking away from each other. One of the men was carrying a white plastic bag with something solid inside. The 43-year-old police officer, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 16 years of experience, stopped the patrol unit slightly behind the man with the bag. The 32-year-old officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 9 years of experience, exited the passenger’s side of the patrol unit and asked the man where he lived. The man turned and fired at the 32-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, with a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. A round struck the officer in the neck/throat and he fell onto his back near the passenger side at the rear of the patrol unit. The assailant continued to fire his weapon while advancing on the other officer, who was still sitting in the driver’s seat. The assailant entered the patrol unit’s open door on the passenger’s side and shot the 43-year-old officer at close range in the rear of his head, his front upper torso/chest, and his arms/hands. The victim officer was wearing body armor, but a round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of the vest. The injured officer outside of the vehicle was able to draw his service weapon and fire on the fleeing assailant, striking him with one of the rounds.

The 34-year-old deputy, who had nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, was conducting a traffic stop in a residential area shortly after 11 p.m. A 37- year-old deputy, with nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, was providing backup at the scene and had parked his vehicle behind the responding deputy’s patrol car. The female driver of the stopped vehicle had a male passenger who was sitting in the front seat. When the 34-year-old deputy requested to see the woman’s driver’s identification, she complied. The deputy took her driver’s license and vehicle documentation and returned to his vehicle.

The deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with almost 7 years of experience, had been dispatched to a single- vehicle accident with injury in New Boston. Upon discovering that the driver had fled the scene, the veteran deputy and a New Boston police officer, who also had responded to the scene, began searching for the driver in a wooded area near the wrecked vehicle. The deputy found the suspect, and the other officer heard the deputy ask the suspect if he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The deputy called to the other officer that he was bringing the suspect out of the heavily wooded area and would handcuff him when he got to the clearing. Just after that verbal exchange, the officer observed the beam from the deputy’s flashlight moving erratically and heard a shot. When the officer got to the deputy, the victim stated, “He got my gun and shot me.” The officer and other first responders immediately began to give aid to the deputy, who was wounded in the shoulder. (It was later revealed that the bullet from the deputy’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun had traveled to his lung, wounding him fatally.) The suspect moved deeper into the woods as the officers worked to treat the deputy. A few minutes later, the officers heard another shot. Apparently, the 36-year-old man had committed suicide with one shot to the head from the deputy’s service weapon, which was found in the shooter’s hand. Subsequent investigation revealed that the man, who had prior convictions, had been drinking and smoking crack cocaine earlier in the evening, as witnessed by three companions.

Five officers answered the call for service. The 29-year-old officer spoke with the complainant, who explained that two of the men were “minding their own business,” when the suspect approached the man in the front passenger seat in an aggressive manner, yelling at him.

The officer’s body camera recorded the suspect face down on the ground with a silver cell phone beside him. Both the lieutenant and the officer repeatedly told the suspect to stand up and speak with them, but he would not comply. At that point, one of the three men initially involved in the altercation at the gas station drove up with his brother, parked alongside the officers, got out, and spoke with the officers. The suspect got up and lunged toward the vehicle, prompting one of the two men to move toward the suspect in an attempt to keep him from entering the vehicle. The suspect turned and ran north. The officer pursued him. When the officer caught up with the suspect, the suspect slowed his pace, turned around, and struck the officer, knocking him to the ground.

When the officer arrived at the scene, he met the store owner, who described the suspect to him. The officer located the suspect inside the store and approached him. The suspect tried to leave the business, but the veteran officer, who had 17 years of law enforcement experience, told him to stop. The suspect continued to walk toward the exit. The officer followed him and pulled out his handcuffs as he prepared to detain the suspect. The suspect pulled away from the officer, and a fight ensued. The officer radioed dispatch for assistance and dragged the suspect to the ground to gain control over him; however, the suspect broke free and stood over the officer. Footage from the business’ security camera showed the suspect pulled a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from his waistband and fired a single shot, striking the officer in the neck/throat. The suspect left the scene, but minutes later another officer apprehended him a short distance from the market. The suspect had dropped the firearm on the ground near where officers arrested him, and officers found the stolen check in the suspect’s pants pocket.

During the encounter, a motorist drove up to the group, began speaking with the officer and asked to speak with the officer’s supervisor. The officer used his police radio to ask the sergeant to come to the location. When the veteran sergeant, who had nearly 11 years of law enforcement experience, responded to the scene, he asked the three individuals to leave so he could address the interaction between the officer and the motorist.

Once the man was gone, the woman called 911 and reported the incident. The 41-year-old sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 19 years of experience, and another officer began searching for the suspect’s vehicle using details provided by dispatchers. The sergeant and the officer, in a marked police vehicle, spotted the suspect’s vehicle and followed it. The sergeant provided their location to dispatch, allowing other police units to converge on the area. The suspect attempted to evade the pursuing officers by turning onto a succession of streets, but responding officers eventually blocked the suspect’s path with their police vehicles. To avoid the blockade, the suspect attempted a U-turn. However, another police vehicle collided with the rear of the suspect’s vehicle, causing him to lose control and strike a parked dump truck. With the suspect’s vehicle trapped between the dump truck and a police vehicle, responding officers attempted to take him into custody.

As the officer, who was wearing protective body armor, and his partner attempted to take the man into custody, the suspect drew a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the victim officer at close range in the back of the head. After firing several additional shots, the offender carjacked a vehicle and took the driver hostage. The victim officer was rushed to a local medical center where he died an hour later. About the same time, an unmarked special assignment unit spotted the car matching the carjacked vehicle’s description and boxed in the vehicle. The suspect pointed his gun towards his hostage, and an officer of the special unit shot and killed him before he was able to harm the hostage or anyone else. The deceased offender was 22 years of age and had an extensive criminal history.",959

"An off-duty police officer with the Chicago Police Department was shot on May 19 in a robbery attempt involving four male suspects. Shortly before 11:30 p.m., the 30-year-old officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, had gotten on his motorcycle and was about to drive away when two males, ages 19 and 20, approached the officer and announced they were going to rob him. The 20-year- old robber produced a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and placed it to the officer’s head. A retired officer had been standing in the doorway of his nearby home and saw the robbery in progress. The retired officer yelled to the offenders, who told the retired officer to mind his own business and the armed robber fired his weapon at him. The 20-year-old robber moved the handgun away from the officer’s head, the officer announced that he was a police officer, retrieved his weapon, and fired at the offenders. The officer and the 20-year-old assailant exchanged gunfire at close range. The officer fired eight rounds, all of which struck the offenders, who were standing near each other. The armed assailant fired four rounds, one of which grazed the officer’s rear below the waist and one that struck him fatally in the center of his torso, above his abdomen. As this was happening, the retired officer retrieved a handgun from his residence. He saw a vehicle on the scene and saw the 19-year-old offender attempting to help the 20-year-old offender into the car. The retired officer then walked toward the street and saw two additional males in the car, one of whom had a handgun. The retired officer saw the two offenders at the side of the vehicle and saw one raise a handgun, at which point the retired officer fired on the men. The men in the vehicle backed it away from the scene, appearing to leave the two offenders behind. Apparently, the victim officer was struck and dragged by the vehicle and then was dislodged when the driver put the car in reverse to pick up the offenders. The retired officer then went to assist the victim officer, and all of the offenders fled. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital where he died the next day. The 20-year-old suspect, who was known to possess drugs and had a prior criminal record involving violent crime and drug and weapons violations, was killed by the victim officer’s gunfire. The other three men—the 19-year-old, a 20-year-old male passenger, and a 29-year-old male passenger—also had prior criminal records. All three suspects were arrested on June 12 and charged with two counts of First-Degree Murder and Armed Robbery.",600
"On April 19 at 3:01 p.m., two officers with the Gilchrist County Sheriff’s Office were feloniously killed in an ambush (entrapment/premeditation) in Trenton. A 25-year-old deputy sheriff and a 29-year-old sergeant were on their meal break at a local restaurant when a subject entered the establishment armed with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle, which was concealed at his right side. Without warning, the subject fired 14 rounds, striking each officer seven times as they sat waiting for their orders. The veteran deputy, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, was struck in the front upper torso/chest, front legs/feet, and fatally in the front of his head. The sergeant, a law enforcement veteran with 7 years of experience, was struck in the side of his head, front upper torso/chest, arms/hands, and fatally in the front of his head. The body armor of each officer was circumvented when rounds entered between the vests’ side panels. The 59-year-old subject returned to his vehicle where he fatally shot himself in the head with a 9 mm handgun before responding units arrived. His criminal history included an arrest for a weapons violation.",119
"On October 27 at 11:40 p.m., a corporal and a patrol officer with the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department (SCMPD) were shot and wounded during a traffic stop. The 43-year-old veteran corporal, who had more than 7 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner stopped a vehicle after it failed to yield at an intersection and pulled out in front of their patrol vehicle, nearly causing a collision. The corporal approached the driver’s side of the vehicle, while his partner approached the passenger’s side. The corporal asked the driver for his driver’s license. The driver stated that he did not have his license with him, so the corporal ordered the driver to turn off the vehicle and hand over the keys. The corporal explained that he would place the keys on the vehicle’s roof just long enough to obtain and verify the driver’s information. The driver hesitated to hand over the keys, so the officer quickly took them. The driver continued to exhibit anxious behavior while the corporal was writing down his information, so the corporal asked him to exit the vehicle in order to check him for weapons. About this time, a second patrol vehicle arrived to provide backup. A 27-year-old SCMPD patrol officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner got out of the patrol vehicle. The patrol officer approached the driver’s side of the vehicle and stood behind the corporal as his partner walked toward the passenger’s side. The corporal opened the driver’s side door to allow the driver to exit the vehicle as he had requested. The driver did not comply and started inching toward the vehicle’s center console. When the corporal noticed the driver reaching into the console, he repeatedly commanded the driver to put his hands where the corporal could see them. The driver did not comply and continued reaching into the console, so the corporal leaned into the vehicle’s open door. With his left hand, the corporal grabbed the driver’s left arm while drawing his service weapon with his right hand. The driver suddenly exited the vehicle and fired a .38-caliber revolver in the direction of the corporal and the patrol officer, who were both wearing body armor. Both officers were struck in the front below the waist—the corporal in the left hip and the patrol officer in the right hip. When the suspect attempted to flee, three of the four officers returned fire. The 25-year-old suspect was fatally wounded. The suspect had a prior criminal record that included police assault, a violent crime, and a drug law violation. The victim corporal and victim patrol officer were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Both officers recovered from their wounds and returned to duty.",948
"On November 11 around 10:45 p.m., a patrol officer with the Clearwater Police Department was wounded while responding to a disturbance call. The officer, a 47-year-old veteran of law enforcement with 15 years’ experience, responded to a report of an individual assaulting a female in a parking lot. On-scene witnesses directed the officer to an intense argument between two men who were being physically separated by a security guard. Witnesses informed the officer that one of the men had assaulted a woman prior to the officer’s arrival. The other man turned away from the argument and began to walk away, but the offender raised his fists and lunged at the man. The officer ordered the offender to stop; however, the offender did not comply. The officer rushed the offender and forced him into a seated position on a nearby bench. The offender lunged at the officer, knocking them both to the ground. A physical altercation ensued, and the officer, who was wearing body armor, attempted to restrain and arrest the suspect. During the struggle, the suspect produced a 2 ½-inch knife and stabbed the officer’s left hip and thigh (front below waist/groin area) between 10 and 12 times. The officer knocked the suspect off balance and again attempted to restrain him. While the suspect was down, he began stabbing the officer’s lower right leg. At some point during the confrontation, the suspect stabbed the officer in the front upper torso/chest, but the officer’s body armor prevented the blade from reaching the officer. Two additional officers arrived and joined in the efforts to arrest the suspect. The officers attempted to subdue the suspect with an electronic control weapon, but they were unsuccessful due to the suspect’s struggling and resistance. After fighting with the suspect for approximately two minutes, the officers disarmed and restrained him and placed him under arrest. During the scuffle, one of the additional officers, whose age and years of service were not reported, received a stab wound to his hand. The first victim officer was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and released later that evening.

The injured officer has since returned to duty.",1217
"A 48-year-old sergeant with the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office was killed in San Antonio in an unprovoked attack on May 28 shortly after 2 a.m. The veteran sergeant, with more than 25 years of law enforcement service, was called to assist at a scene where shots had been fired. Driving a marked patrol vehicle en route to the scene, the sergeant stopped at a red light. At that time, a man in a truck pulled up next to the patrol car and began shooting into the door and window of the sergeant’s vehicle. The shooter fired at least 40 rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. More than 20 shots went through the door and window striking the sergeant in the chest, neck, and fatally in the side of his head. The suspect then fled the scene in his truck. The sergeant died before he could be transported to a hospital. A multi-jurisdictional task force made up of local, state, and federal law enforcement officers was formed to investigate the incident and locate the suspect. Eight days after the shooting, a 41-year-old man was arrested at his residence without incident. A rifle seized at the man’s home was determined to be the weapon that was used to shoot the veteran sergeant. It is suspected that the man was intoxicated and on prescription antidepressant medication at the time of the incident. He had a prior criminal record and convictions, including police assault and weapons violations. The suspect was charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.",1105
"On December 8 around 9:30 p.m., a 53-year-old Oklahoma City Police Department (OCPD) sergeant was assaulted during a traffic stop. The veteran sergeant, with nearly 18 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a vehicle after the driver committed a traffic violation. The man driving the vehicle was a known local gang member. The sergeant approached the vehicle and realized the driver was using his cell phone, telling someone he had been stopped by the police and was giving his current location. During the course of the traffic stop, the sergeant returned to his police unit and was headed back to the man’s vehicle when he heard gunshots and realized the rounds were directed toward him. Four officers who had just arrived on the scene took cover behind their vehicles. They saw a person running from the location of the gunfire, through a field, toward a nearby apartment complex. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, felt a burning sensation and realized he had been wounded in his arms/hands when a round from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun grazed his wrist. He then located a spent projectile in his jacket pocket. The offender discharged a total of six rounds, two of which struck a police vehicle. A search was conducted, but the shooter was not apprehended. A firearm and spent shell casings were collected along with other evidence. Further investigation determined the driver of the stopped vehicle had been talking on the cell phone with another gang member. Subsequent interviews revealed three known gang members were in a nearby apartment at the time of the incident. OCPD officers arrested two gang members on December 12. A 27-year-old gang member was charged with five counts of Shooting with the Intent to Kill. He had a criminal history including a violent crime, drug law violation, and weapons violation, and was on supervised probation at the time of the incident.

"A deputy sheriff with the Norman County Sheriff’s Office has returned to work after being assaulted around 8:30 a.m. on April 15 while investigating a suspicious person in Ada. The 26-year-old deputy, who had 3½ years of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to check a suspicious vehicle parked along a local highway. After identifying the driver and a passenger in the vehicle, the deputy was informed that the passenger had an active warrant in a neighboring county for Failure to Appear. The deputy took the passenger, who was the brother of the driver, into custody and notified the driver where his brother was being taken and the amount for his bail. The deputy then told the driver he was free to go. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, walked back to his patrol unit to clear the scene. When he reached for the door handle, he was struck in his rear upper torso/back with a round from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, knocking him to the ground. As the deputy stood up, the driver of the vehicle fired at him again, and a round struck his portable radio on his front upper torso/chest. The deputy took cover behind his patrol unit as the 19-year-old suspect continued firing. The deputy returned fire, striking the rear window of the suspect’s vehicle. The deputy fired several rounds, emptying his weapon. As he reloaded, the suspect drove off. The deputy was then able to get into his vehicle and radio for assistance.

"At 11:45 a.m. on March 21, a 47-year-old veteran patrol officer with the Omaha Police Department, who had 25 years of law enforcement experience, was assaulted by a man with a knife during a drug-related situation. Earlier, a man whose vehicle was being impounded in front of his residence confronted an officer who was completing the impound report and waiting for a tow truck. When the man engaged the officer in a verbal disagreement, the officer advised him to go back inside his residence. After the suspect went inside, the officer observed that a baggie appearing to contain methamphetamine had fallen out of the man’s pocket and was lying on the ground. The officer then advised the dispatcher to send additional officers. When additional officers arrived, the man came out of his residence and began yelling at them. The officers, one of whom was the 47-year-old veteran officer, went to speak to the man and arrest him for the suspected narcotics which had fallen from his pocket. However, the man ran into his residence and officers followed. As the officers attempted to arrest him, he resisted and produced a kitchen knife. A struggle ensued, during which the suspect cut the veteran officer on his gloved hand (the knife penetrated the glove). Another officer used an electronic control weapon to subdue the suspect, and the suspect was taken into custody. The 32-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record and was under the influence of narcotics at the time of incident, was arrested and charged with Second-Degree Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, Use of Weapon to Commit a Felony, and Possession of a Controlled Substance.

"Just after 8 p.m. on June 19, a 31-year-old police officer with the Port Orchard Police Department (Port Orchard PD) was assaulted and injured while attempting an arrest. The officer, along with two other Port Orchard PD officers, were attempting to locate a suspect who had a felony warrant from another state for Child Molestation and misdemeanor warrants for Assault, Assault-Domestic Violence, and Malicious Mischief-Domestic Violence. The officers located the suspect inside a bar. Two of the officers entered the bar, one of whom was the 31-year-old officer who had 1½ years of law enforcement experience. The third officer stationed himself in an alley near the bar’s back door. The suspect, who worked as a disc jockey in the bar, requested that he be permitted to shut down the music system. As the man moved toward the stage, he grabbed a knife and fled out the back door. The two officers pursued the man on foot. The pursuit continued into the alley where the suspect turned to confront the officers. Both officers discharged their electronic control devices (ECDs), but the ECDs had no effect. The suspect lunged at the 31-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, with the knife extended. The officers fired their service weapons, striking the suspect. However, before he was hit, the individual was able to stab the 31-year-old officer in the front below the waist (just above the left kneecap).

"A 37-year-old patrol officer with the Northampton Township Police Department is back to duty after surviving a shooting incident during an investigative activity shortly after 6 p.m. on April 18 in Holland. The officer, a 14-year veteran of law enforcement, responded to a call of shots fired. The dispatcher indicated that the suspect had left the scene and provided a description of the suspect’s vehicle. Another officer relayed the likely identity of the suspect, a man already known to law enforcement. Once in the area, the officer saw the suspect’s vehicle headed north near a local shopping center, and he advised other units of its location. Suddenly, the suspect’s vehicle stopped, and the driver exited with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. He fired three rounds at the officer who was seated in his patrol vehicle. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was hit in the arms/hands and the front upper torso/chest. Still in his patrol vehicle, he reported shots fired, and returned fire. As he exited his vehicle to take cover behind it, the officer continued to return fire. The suspect returned to the front seat of his vehicle, and apparently attempted to reload his weapon. The officer continued to return fire from behind his patrol vehicle.

"Just after 9 p.m. on March 9, a 30-year-old police officer with 6 months of law enforcement experience with the Pomona Police Department (PPD) was shot and killed while responding to a disturbance call that ultimately became a tactical situation. Earlier on the day of the incident, officers had responded to a domestic disturbance call, but by the time officers arrived, the subject of the call had left in his vehicle. Family members of the subject decided to pursue him in their vehicle. The resulting pursuit was reported by witnesses, and PPD officers unsuccessfully attempted a traffic stop. The subject fled to his residence where he barricaded himself in a bedroom. Officers arrived at the scene and conducted a protective sweep of the residence and determined that it was empty other than the subject, who had barricaded himself in his room. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, approached the locked bedroom door using a ballistic shield. As the officer drew closer, the subject fired through the door with a .357-caliber revolver, fatally striking the victim officer in the front of the head just above the shield. Officers returned gunfire. The subject fired another round that ricocheted off the door and struck a 26-year-old PPD police officer in the side of the face, penetrating his cheek and lodging in his teeth. The wounded officer, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, was admitted to the hospital for treatment.

The veteran officer, who had 12 ½ years of law enforcement experience, was on duty at an intersection when two vehicles passed through the intersection, one right after the other. The officer activated his lights and pulled over the second vehicle, a car. (Investigation later showed the officer may have pulled the car over because it had no license plate.) Seeing the police vehicle’s lights, the driver of the first vehicle, a sport utility vehicle (SUV), pulled over in front of the car. As the officer approached the driver’s window of the car, he waved the driver of the SUV on, indicating that she did not need to stay. When the officer turned his attention to the driver of the car, the driver fatally shot the officer once in the head below his right eye at close range with a .357 magnum revolver.

Approximately two hours earlier, a person called 911 to report that someone had shot at his vehicle as he was driving. The caller described the suspect vehicle’s color, make, and model to the dispatcher. At 10:45 p.m., a deputy from the Weld County Sheriff’s Office located the suspect’s vehicle approximately 11 miles away at a gas station. The deputy noted the vehicle’s license plate number before the driver fled in the vehicle. Nearly an hour later, the GPD officer, who had 2 ½ years of law enforcement experience, located the vehicle being driven by the suspect and began a pursuit.

"A 44-year-old sergeant with the Utah County Sheriff’s Office (Utah County SO) was killed, and a 38-year- old deputy sheriff with the same agency was injured while investigating a suspicious vehicle on January 30. Just after 1 p.m., the sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with 19 years of experience, observed a truck with its emergency lights flashing along the side of the road in Eagle Mountain. The sergeant turned on his overhead lights and pulled behind the stopped truck. He exited his patrol unit and communicated with the driver and a passenger. The driver provided the sergeant with her license, and the passenger gave a name. The sergeant used the computer in his patrol unit and verified the driver and the vehicle information, but the passenger had provided a false name. The sergeant returned to the truck, gave the driver her license and attempted to clarify the passenger’s true identity. The sergeant returned to his patrol unit. Still unable to determine the man’s true name, the sergeant approached the truck a third time, and once again inquired about the man’s name and date of birth. The sergeant returned to the computer in his patrol unit to attempt to search the passenger’s identity. The video from the sergeant’s dashboard camera showed the brake lights glowing as the driver placed the truck in drive. Approximately 4 minutes later, when there was no observable traffic, the passenger quickly opened the back sliding window of the truck, pointed a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun toward the sergeant’s patrol unit, and fired seven rounds. One round struck the victim sergeant, who was wearing body armor, in the neck/throat; and one round struck him fatally in the front of his head. The female suspect quickly accelerated and drove the truck from the scene. Because the sergeant had entered the driver and vehicle information into the agency’s system, dispatchers were able to put out an “attempt to locate” call on the suspects’ truck. Just before 3 p.m., the 38-year-old deputy with the Utah County SO located the truck and attempted to stop the driver as she prepared to exit onto the interstate in Santaquin. The driver did not exit and began accelerating. Video from the dashboard camera shows that approximately 45 seconds into the pursuit, the driver applied her brakes to close the distance between the two vehicles. The passenger opened the rear window of the truck and fired two rounds at the deputy. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, was hit in the side of the head with one round, but he survived. The suspects then exited onto the interstate, and an extensive chase ensued, which included assistance from the Utah Highway Patrol (Utah HP) and the Juab County Sheriff’s Office (Juab County SO). During the pursuit, the passenger fired on a Utah HP trooper, and officers used tire-deflation devices in an attempt to stop the suspects. The suspects drove over the device but kept going. The passenger fired on a semi-tractor trailer and struck three tires. The suspect’s truck then collided with another vehicle, causing damage to both vehicles. Their truck broke down at the bottom of an exit ramp, and the suspects fled while exchanging gunfire with officers. The suspects carjacked a vehicle belonging to a woman who had a child with her. The male suspect forced them out at gunpoint and drove the woman’s vehicle south on the highway. Officers also used a tire-deflation device on this vehicle, and when the vehicle became disabled, the suspect drove into oncoming traffic and caused an accident. Both suspects fled the vehicle and attempted another carjacking, but the driver of that vehicle sped away and caused the suspected shooter to fall to the ground. When four deputies from the Juab County SO caught up to the two suspects, they ordered the man to drop his weapon. The 27-year-old suspect, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, pointed the firearm toward them. The deputies fired rounds and shot the suspect, who had a prior criminal record and had been convicted previously. He succumbed to his injuries the next morning. The 17-year-old driver of the vehicle was arrested and taken into custody.

"Shortly after 7 p.m. on July 5, a 22-year-old deputy sheriff with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office (JPSO) was killed while responding to a domestic disturbance call in Gretna. Information received in the call indicated that a handgun was possibly in the possession of someone at the home involved in the disturbance. When the deputy sheriff, who had 1 year of law enforcement experience, arrived at the home, he exited his vehicle and was immediately met by gunfire from a person standing in the home’s open garage. One of the bullets from the .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun entered the armhole of the deputy sheriff’s protective vest, fatally wounding him in the chest. Although he unholstered his service weapon before being shot, the victim deputy sheriff was unable to return fire. After assisting officers arrived at the location, the deputy sheriff was transported to a local hospital where he died several hours later. At the scene, other people in the home were able to escape without injury, including the suspect’s girlfriend, with whom the suspect had argued earlier that day. The suspect’s mother reported that after her son had shot the deputy sheriff, he went upstairs to a bathroom and closed the door. She then heard a single, final gunshot. The JPSO SWAT team arrived, assessed the scene, and tried to make contact with the suspect.

The 27-year-old veteran officer, who had more than 6 years of law enforcement experience, saw an individual at a condominium complex and contacted dispatch and other officers inquiring about the individual’s identity. While the officer was making the inquiries, the individual left the complex on foot. About two blocks from the complex, the officer saw the individual walking along the road.

The deputy, who had 21½ years of law enforcement experience, transferred a prisoner in a marked transport van from a mental facility to a secure area in the basement of the county courthouse for a hearing at 1 p.m. At the hearing, the judge ordered that the prisoner be returned to the mental facility.

Shortly after the hearing, the veteran deputy evidently permitted the prisoner to exit the vehicle, and the prisoner overpowered her. He apparently took the deputy’s .38-caliber service revolver and fired one fatal round into the side of her head. The 21-year-old alleged shooter then took the transport van and left the scene.

The officer tried to initiate contact with the pair; however, both subjects ignored him. As the officer turned to check on traffic, the male subject rushed at the officer. The suspect stabbed the officer in the front upper torso/chest with a knife that had a 12-inch blade, piercing the officer’s body armor and causing a puncture wound of more than an inch. The suspect then ran back to the woman, who was his pregnant girlfriend, and began to stab her. The officer fired one round at the suspect from his .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, but missed.

The veteran lieutenant, who had nearly 23 years of law enforcement experience, was patrolling an area near a housing complex when he noticed three or four people loitering at the complex. He stopped his vehicle and told them to leave the area. The lieutenant circled the complex and came back to where he first saw the group, and they were still there. He stopped his vehicle and exited but did not notify the dispatcher that he had left the vehicle or that he was investigating suspicious persons. The lieutenant ordered the individuals to place their hands on the patrol vehicle. As he was patting down one of the individuals, a man pulled out a .32-caliber revolver from his waistband and fired three shots, striking the victim lieutenant in the chest, back of the head, and fatally in the neck.

"Around 2 p.m. earlier that day, officers were dispatched to investigate a domestic assault in Little Water, New Mexico. Upon their arrival at the scene, they were immediately met with gunfire from a male suspect. No officers were hurt, and the suspect fled the area. A command post was established, and units from many other law enforcement agencies were called in. Approximately 3 hours later, the suspect drove past the command post. All units were notified and headed out in pursuit. When approached by a responding officer, the suspect stopped, exited his vehicle, and then began firing at the officer’s vehicle, disabling it. The man got back into his vehicle, and other officers pursued him. The chase continued and crossed the border into mountains in Arizona where officers eventually found the suspect’s vehicle on a dirt road, appearing to have become stuck in snow. The suspect, who was hiding nearby, fired on the first police vehicle to approach his abandoned car, and the officer backed down the mountain. Because the suspect’s exact location was unknown at the time, the officers used a police vehicle as a rolling barricade to proceed up the hill toward the abandoned vehicle. The suspect had apparently crossed the road, and as the pursuing officers became exposed to him, he fired several shots toward them with a .223-caliber rifle. A 48-year-old police officer was shot in the front below the waist and later had to have his leg amputated. A 41-year-old officer was shot in the rear below the waist. A 42-year-old police officer, who was wearing body armor, was shot once in the back of the head and was found several feet from the barricade vehicle; he died at the scene.

"The Puerto Rico Department of Environment and Natural Resources lost two of its rangers on March 23 at 12:30 a.m. while they were on guard duty at the agency’s facility in San Juan. Each of the rangers was 30 years old and each had nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience. Both rangers, who were wearing body armor, were going about their normal duties, unaware that two men who intended to steal their service weapons were watching them. The two men had maintained their surveillance for more than an hour when one of the rangers left the guard station to go on his rounds within the property, leaving the other ranger alone in the small building. The would-be robbers then climbed over the fence surrounding the property and entered the guard shack. One of the perpetrators, a 23-year-old man, pointed a .45-caliber handgun at the ranger. The ranger fell to the ground in surprise, and the attacker attempted to take the ranger’s 9 mm semiautomatic service handgun. A short struggle ensued as the ranger fought to keep possession of his weapon, but the attacker gained control and shot the victim ranger with the service weapon, striking him in the arms/hands. The shooter handed one of the handguns to the second perpetrator, a 35-year-old man. Meanwhile, the second ranger, who had detected the intruders, moved to a position in front of the guard station near a large rock where he opened fire on the two assailants with his service weapon, also a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The 23- year-old attacker was shot in the left calf. After a few more shots were exchanged, the second ranger fell to the ground, mortally wounded when a bullet from his partner’s stolen 9 mm service handgun struck him in the side of his head. The 23-year-old attacker went to the body to steal the fallen ranger’s service handgun, but he could not find the weapon. He returned to the guard station and saw that the first ranger was still moving. He shot the ranger fatally in the side of the head. Because of the attacker’s calf wound, he was unable to jump over the fence that they had scaled to enter the property. The pair then stole a truck that was parked next to the guard shack and drove it through the gate that was locked with a chain. They joined a third man, a 21-year-old, who was part of the original robbery plan, and fled to the home of the 23-year-old man. Later that morning, the 21-year-old and the 35-year-old suspects were detained in an unrelated traffic stop. When police searched the vehicle, they found the 9 mm service weapon belonging to the first victim ranger. All three men, who were known to use drugs and who were under the influence of narcotics, were subsequently arrested. The 23-year-old man was charged with Carjacking and Murder. The 35-year-old man was charged with Carjacking, Murder, Stolen Weapon, and Interstate Commerce. The 21-year-old man was charged with Possession of a Stolen Firearm and Accessory After the Fact.

"On November 18, two veteran patrol officers with the Ridgewood Police Department (Ridgewood PD) sustained injuries while handling a person with a mental illness. Shortly after 2 p.m., the two officers, a 42-year-old with nearly 15 years of law enforcement experience and a 33-year-old with nearly 9 years of experience, responded to a disturbance call from a residential mental health center. When officers arrived on scene along with a Ridgewood PD sergeant, a case worker explained a resident was agitated and had insinuated that he might burn down the center. The case worker explained to the officers he had called an operator at the local psychiatric emergency screening program and requested a screener to evaluate the resident. However, the operator advised the case worker that screeners were not available at that time and suggested he call the police instead. The officers located the resident in his bedroom on the second floor and explained the reason they were called. When the resident became agitated once again, the officers suggested that they escort him to the hospital for an evaluation. While the two officers continued to speak to the resident, the sergeant again contacted the emergency screening program. An operator confirmed that no one was available to come to the center to provide a screening. The operator also told the sergeant that following a previous violent crime, a superior court placed the resident on Krol Status (i.e., the superior court was monitoring his mental health treatment). The operator then recommended to the sergeant that the resident be transported to the hospital for an evaluation. Meanwhile, the resident was making threats and arguing with the two officers. The sergeant informed the operator that the resident’s condition was worsening and that he would transport him to the hospital as recommended. The sergeant then requested backup and an ambulance. The sergeant explained to the resident he was to be taken to a local hospital for evaluation. Initially, the resident refused and stated that he would fight the officers. The two officers continued to talk to the resident and eventually convinced him to comply. At that time, another officer and a member of Ridgewood Emergency Services arrived; they all escorted the resident to the first floor. Before exiting the center, the sergeant told the resident that he needed to search him for hidden weapons. Once again, the resident became very agitated and refused to be transported. The sergeant advised the resident that a weapon search was standard procedure and requested his cooperation. The resident refused to comply, clenching his fist and taking a combative stance. The 42-year-old officer moved in and attempted to grab the resident, who reached into his left pocket and pulled out a folding metal knife with the blade open. When the resident raised the knife into the air, the 33-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, joined the scuffle. Both officers grabbed the resident’s arm as they wrestled to control him. The resident swung the knife at the 33-year-old officer’s head, slicing the officer’s hat. During the struggle, the 33- year-old officer received a puncture wound on his arms/hands, and the 42-year-old officer received a laceration on his arms/hands. The officers pulled the 55-year-old resident to the ground, disarmed him, and placed him in handcuffs. The resident remained combative as he was immobilized and placed on a stretcher. He was taken into custody and transported to a local hospital for an evaluation. The resident had a prior criminal record including police assault, a violent crime, weapons violations, and drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. The resident was charged with Aggravated Assault. Both officers were taken to a local hospital where they were treated and released. They have recovered from their injuries and have returned to their duties.",931

He was transported to the trauma center at a local hospital where he succumbed to the wound to the side of his head. The assistant chief served as the commander of the internal affairs unit, and a subsequent investigation revealed that the subject was angry about an internal affairs complaint he had filed that was not resolved to his satisfaction. The subject planned, stalked, and waited for the chief to arrive at work in order to ambush him with his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Video footage from the courthouse parking lot showed the subject had been at the parking lot the day before, casing it to see where the chief parked his vehicle. The 64-year-old subject had a criminal history including a drug law violation and a violent crime. He committed suicide on April 4.",792

"On November 13, a sergeant, aged 47, with the Tallahassee Police Department was shot and killed at 8 p.m. while responding to a robbery in progress. Reportedly, after kicking in the back door of a residence, a man held two females at gunpoint in the living room while he searched for drugs. Eventually, the man put the females in the bathroom and continued to loot their home, placing jewelry and compact discs into a pillowcase that he took to his vehicle; he then returned to remove a computer. While in the bathroom, one of the females called 911 on a cellular telephone, and officers with the Tallahassee Police Department were dispatched to the residence. Upon arriving, the sergeant, who had nearly 14 years’ law enforcement experience, parked one block away and walked toward the residence, which was located at the end of a dead end road with no lighting. After observing an idling vehicle at the end of the driveway, the veteran sergeant radioed dispatch with the vehicle’s license plate number. A second officer arrived at the scene and went to the rear of the residence; the sergeant moved toward the side of the residence where the front door was located. When the sergeant approached the door with his weapon drawn, a man emerged with a .357-caliber revolver and shot the sergeant fatally in the back of his head from a distance of 5 feet or less, as well as in the stomach below his body armor, the back, below his waist in the back, and his arms and hands. A third officer entering the area then saw the individual get into his vehicle and flee the scene through a field. Within minutes, officers located the vehicle and a pursuit ensued. They hit the assailant’s vehicle with the police car, and both vehicles slid from the roadway. Officers then apprehended the man, who confessed to the robbery and to firing the handgun at the scene of the crime. The 32-year-old suspect, who had an extensive criminal history and had been released from prison 4 1⁄2 months earlier, was arrested and charged with Homicide of a Law Enforcement Officer, Robbery with a Firearm, Burglary of a Dwelling, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, Fleeing Police, and Kidnapping.",930
"On February 16, a 24-year-old deputy marshal with the U.S. Marshals Service of Clarksburg was shot and killed, and another deputy marshal and a supervisory deputy marshal were shot and injured while involved in a tactical situation around 8 a.m. in Elkins. Surveillance of a residence began about 6 a.m., as law enforcement officers prepared to serve a federal arrest warrant for a man wanted on charges of Possession with Intent to Distribute Crack Cocaine and Unlawful User in Possession of Firearms; officials also planned to search the residence. About 2 hours later, five deputy marshals and a West Virginia state trooper knocked on the front door, announced their presence, and requested entry into the home. After several unsuccessful attempts to have the occupants answer the door, the deputy marshals and the trooper decided to use a battering ram to breach it. Once the door was forced open, four deputy marshals and one trooper entered. The fifth deputy marshal remained on the porch securing the battering ram, and two additional deputy marshals, a second state trooper, and a task force officer from the Fairmont Police Department secured the perimeter of the residence. Inside the foyer, deputy marshals and the trooper issued verbal commands demanding that any occupants come out with their hands up. Instead, they were met with gunfire from behind a closed door down the hallway directly in front of them. The suspect fired five rounds from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, fatally striking the 24-year-old deputy marshal, who had nearly 2 years of law enforcement experience, in the lower neck area above his body armor and in the front of his head; he died at the scene.

"A 55-year-old deputy sheriff with the St. Francois County Sheriff’s Department died on July 4, from injuries he sustained approximately 8 months earlier while investigating suspicious persons or circumstances in Bonne Terre. Just before 9:30 a.m. on October 27, 2015, the veteran deputy, with 23 years of law enforcement experience, had finished delivering some civil processes when he noticed two trucks parked on a dirt road near a creek. The county had recently experienced burglaries and vandalism in the area, and the location was frequently used for illegal dumping. The deputy decided to stop and investigate. He spoke first with a man standing near the larger of the two trucks before he moved around and spoke with a male and female at the front of the smaller truck. The pair told the deputy that approximately 30 minutes earlier, they had taken a small pickup truck down the dirt road, and it had gotten stuck in sand near the creek. The man called his friend (who had the larger pickup truck) for help. They said the friend came and pulled out the small truck, but now the small truck would not start. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, did not see a tow chain and at one point during the contact, the small truck did start. The deputy asked the couple with the small truck for identification. The female provided her identification, but the male said he did not have any. The deputy told the man to walk with him to his patrol vehicle so he could write down the man’s identifying information. The man complied and began to follow the deputy. When the pair reached the front driver’s side of the patrol unit, the man ran away from the officer toward the larger pickup truck which belonged to the other man. The officer began chasing the man and radioed dispatch advising them he was in a foot pursuit. No one was in the idling larger truck, and the man jumped in and began driving the truck toward the officer. The deputy yelled for the man to stop and when he did not, the deputy drew his weapon and fired seven rounds at the windshield of the truck. The man did not  stop, instead he accelerated toward the officer, who was standing in the middle of the road. The deputy moved to his right to get out of the way, but the man steered the vehicle toward him, striking the deputy with the vehicle before fleeing. The victim deputy flew through the air and landed approximately 4-5 feet from the edge of the road. He fired his weapon at the truck as it drove away. The victim deputy contacted dispatchers and provided a description of the truck and the direction of travel. Emergency personnel arrived and transported the injured deputy to a local hospital. Later that day, officers responded to a call of a vehicle driving erratically and discovered it was the stolen truck. A pursuit ensued and ended in a rural area approximately 30 minutes away. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot. Assisting officers arrived on scene and began searching the vehicle; there were bullet holes in the hood and windshield.

Just then, an assisting patrol officer, who had nearly 12 years’ law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene; the two officers identified the pedestrian and attempted to investigate this suspicious person. However, the man ran into the woods, so the officers ran after him. From a distance of 11-20 feet, the suspect allegedly fired at the assisting officer six times with a .357-caliber revolver, striking him in the face, the hand, and the leg. The victim officer returned fire and hit the suspect once. Responding emergency personnel administered medical aid to the victim officer and transported him to a medical center in Worcester where he was treated for his wounds. The 26-year-old suspect, who was on probation and had a previous criminal history, was taken into custody and charged with Assault with Intent to Murder, Assault and Battery with a Dangerous Weapon, and Larceny of a Firearm. As a result of the injuries he sustained to his head, the victim officer remained unconscious for 3 1⁄2 years until his death on November 30, 2002.

"Just after 2 a.m. on May 7, a deputy sheriff with the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department was injured in an ambush (entrapment and premeditation) incident in Tempe. The 38-year-old deputy, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, was participating in a task force addressing driving under the influence (DUI). While out with the task force, he saw a motorist commit a traffic infraction. The deputy activated his emergency lights to initiate a traffic stop. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, made contact with the occupants of the vehicle and returned to his unmarked patrol unit to conduct a records check. He exited his patrol unit, and as he was approaching the suspect vehicle again, he heard gunshots and felt pain in his leg. Two rounds from a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle struck the victim deputy in the rear below his waist. As he took cover behind his patrol unit, he looked in the direction of where the shots were fired and saw a moving vehicle, but was unable to get a license plate number. He radioed to dispatchers he had been shot and needed assistance. While responding officers were en route, the injured deputy placed a tourniquet on his leg to slow the bleeding. The victim deputy was transported by ambulance to a local hospital. An investigation led to a 51-year-old suspect. On May 10, detectives went to the suspect’s residence where he asked the officers to go inside with him to continue the conversation. Officers followed the suspect down a hallway to a bedroom. As soon as the suspect entered the bedroom, he picked up a .308-caliber rifle, and turned it on himself. He fired one round into his head, instantly killing himself. Officers conducted a search warrant of the residence and found a weapon matching the caliber of the weapon used to shoot the victim deputy and documentation from a DUI arrest the suspect had received on May 6, just a few hours before the incident. The suspect, who was under the influence of alcohol at the time he shot the victim deputy, had a prior criminal record. The injured deputy recovered from his injuries and has returned to duty.",107

"A 28-year-old police officer with the Germantown Police Department was injured with a cutting instrument while handling a person with a mental illness on January 8. At 7:41 p.m., the police officer, a veteran with 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner responded to a report of a suicidal individual. The dispatcher advised the officers that the subject had a knife, and she was threatening others. When the officers arrived at the residence, a family member requested that the officers go upstairs where a woman was threatening her mother with a kitchen knife. When they arrived upstairs, they saw that the subject was outside a bathroom where she had her mother cornered. The officer’s partner announced they were police and commanded the woman to drop the knife, but she used an expletive and refused to drop it. The woman ignored multiple requests to disarm, while her mother took the distraction as an opportunity to try to slam the door to the bathroom to further block the attack. In response, the woman kicked the door open again and swung the knife toward her mother. Her mother dodged the knife, but the woman pulled the knife back, preparing to swing again. Due to the imminent danger, the officer’s partner grasped the hand holding the knife and took the woman to the ground to prevent her from stabbing her mother. The officer, who was wearing body armor, took the woman’s other hand and began the handcuffing process. The woman actively resisted and managed to stab the victim officer in his arms/hands with the knife before his partner was able to remove the knife from the woman’s hand. The victim officer’s partner handed the knife to another officer who had arrived at the scene. The woman continued to resist and kick the officers. More officers arrived at the residence, and it took four of them to secure the woman and place her into the patrol unit.

"At 12:38 a.m. on March 16, a 25-year-old deputy sheriff with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department was shot and wounded while investigating a strong-arm robbery in Hesperia. Earlier in the evening, an individual robbed a gas station and fled the scene. The deputy responded to the scene around 11:30 p.m. and viewed the gas station’s video footage of the robbery. He noted the suspect’s physical description and vehicle information. A short time later, the deputy located a vehicle matching the one in the video and recognized the driver to be the suspect. The deputy, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, approached the vehicle’s driver-side door and asked the suspect to exit the vehicle. When the suspect refused to comply and became uncooperative, the deputy used pepper spray on the suspect but to no effect. The suspect produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shot the deputy in his front upper torso/chest from 4 feet away. The deputy’s body armor stopped the round, and he sought cover behind his patrol vehicle. The suspect remained in his vehicle and fired 9 more rounds toward the patrol vehicle before driving away. The officer fired 8 rounds with his service weapon at the subject’s retreating vehicle. None of the officer’s rounds struck the offender, but they did cause significant damage to the suspect’s vehicle. The deputy briefly followed the suspect until losing sight of him then pulled over and requested assistance.

"On February 10 at 2 p.m., two officers with the Lufkin Police Department (LPD) sustained injuries while answering a call for service to investigate suspicious circumstances. An individual was hiking through the woods near his home and noticed well-traveled paths leading further into the woods to an unusual campsite. The hiker contacted an LPD officer and described what he saw. Two officers responded to the area and followed the trail leading into the woods. The 41-year-old officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 12 years’ experience, felt something puncture the bottom of both of his feet as he walked along. The officer reached through leaves on the trail and discovered several boards with nails driven through them. The boards were buried so that only the nails were above the ground. The officers cautiously continued until they came upon the camp. Although no one was there at the time, it looked like at least one person currently lived there. The officers searched the area but found no evidence of illegal activity. The officers exited the area using a different trail. While leaving, the second officer, who was 33 years old and a veteran officer with 12 years of law enforcement experience, stepped on additional boards with nails in them, causing injuries to his right foot. They carefully exited the area by sliding their feet on the ground to avoid any other traps along the way. The officers were treated for their injuries at a medical facility and released. Around 4:40 p.m. the next day, the second officer and a sergeant with the police department located a possible suspect. Both officers questioned the 31-year-old subject and discovered he was homeless and living at the camp, which was located on private property. The subject admitted to placing spiked boards on the ground to keep others from stealing his possessions and food. A name check found that the subject had two outstanding traffic warrants. Officers performed a body search and found a small bag of marijuana in his pocket. He was taken into custody for the warrants and was later charged with two counts of Assault Causing Bodily Injury and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.

"A 25-year-old recruit officer with the Amarillo Police Department was shot and injured while answering a call for service on August 31. At 3:44 a.m., the recruit, who had 3 months of law enforcement experience, and a senior officer were dispatched to investigate a glass break alarm at a local business. As the officers neared the scene, they noticed a subject on the street waving his hand to attract their attention, so they pulled over and got out of the patrol unit to speak with him. The subject said he walked by the business, heard the alarm, and saw two people riding away on bicycles. The subject stated he had recently been released from prison and did not want to get into trouble. The officers observed the subject acting suspiciously; he was unsteady on his feet and kept repeating himself. The officers checked the contents of the subject’s backpack. Then, as the subject sat on the curb, the senior officer got into the patrol unit to run a computer check. The computer returned a parole warrant for the subject’s arrest, so the senior officer exited the patrol unit and informed the subject he was under arrest. The subject immediately ran. The officer deployed his electronic control weapon, which was ineffective. The subject ran into the side yard of a residence and was blocked by a wooden fence, so he stopped and turned toward the officers. The subject produced a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired four rounds at the officers while walking toward them. The officers returned fire, striking the subject and causing him to fall to the ground. The recruit, who was wearing body armor, was struck by one round in the front of his legs/feet. The officers could not see the subject’s hands or the firearm he had used, so the senior officer held the fallen subject at gunpoint while he radioed dispatch to report the updated situation. A backup officer covered the senior officer as he handcuffed the subject. Officers found the firearm in the grass near where the subject had been shot. Medical personnel arrived and treated both the recruit and the subject at the scene, then transported them to the hospital. The recruit underwent surgery to remove a round from his foot. At the time of the incident, the subject was under the influence of heroin and amphetamines/methamphetamines. On September 7, the 24-year-old subject was released from the hospital and immediately arrested and charged with First-Degree Attempted Capital Murder. Known to the police department as a user of a controlled substance and for theft, he had previous arrests including a drug law violation, a violent crime, and resisting arrest.

"Two police officers, members of the Alexandria Police Department’s Special Response Team (SRT), were shot and killed on February 20 during a tactical situation involving a high-risk entry. The SRT was activated to execute a search warrant on two houses on the same street. An investigation prior to the search revealed that the suspect was located in one of two houses. Further, he was in possession of a rifle and would likely engage the police in a gun battle. The SRT was split into two teams. Around 12:30 a.m. the team members began executing the search warrant. One team entered and cleared the first house. The second team, which included the victim officers, removed a piece of plywood from the front door frame of the second residence and began using a ram in an attempt to gain entry.

"At 1:30 p.m. on November 8, a 50-year-old police officer with the Show Low Police Department (SLPD) was shot and killed while responding to a disturbance call. Earlier that morning, the officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 20 years’ experience, responded to a local motel where staff had reported patrons acting suspiciously and had requested their removal. The officer initially responded with his commander; however, they were unable to locate the subjects, so the officers left the motel. Ninety minutes later, motel staff called a second time and advised that the subjects had returned, and one of them was in the lobby. The officer and the commander returned to the motel along with an SLPD chief. The commander was advised that one of the subjects had run upstairs into the bar area. The officer encountered the subject leaving the back of the bar. When the commander and the chief arrived at the back of the bar, the man produced a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and pointed it at them. The officers ordered the individual to drop his weapon. The man put the handgun away and was complying with the officers’ commands when he suddenly fled from the officers with his hands in the air. The commander and the chief chased the man around one side of the building as the officer ran around the opposite side. During the chase, the man again pointed the handgun at the commander and the chief before disappearing from sight. The officer, who was coming around the opposite side of the building, encountered the subject. The man fired 9 rounds; one fatally struck the victim officer, who was wearing body armor, in the front of his head. The commander heard the gunshots and discovered the victim officer on the ground. The suspect fled, but the chief stayed with the victim officer as the commander radioed information regarding the suspect’s description and last known direction. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. Information led officers to a cabin in Lakeside where the suspect was holding a hostage. The first officers on the scene saw the suspect pointing a gun to a young female’s head. Officers surrounded the cabin and attempted to negotiate with the suspect. The suspect refused to cooperate and sporadically fired rounds from inside the cabin in the direction of the officers, striking police vehicles.

The deputy, who had more than two years of law enforcement experience, and another deputy responded to a call from a man who stated his son shot his cell phone. The man explained he was currently located outside his residence, and his armed son was inside the home.

"A 42-year-old corporal with the Dover Police Department died on September 1 from injuries he sustained approximately 5 years earlier during a traffic stop. On February 8, 2012, at 5:17 p.m., the 36- year-old corporal and a probation officer were in an unmarked police vehicle on traffic patrol when they observed a suspicious vehicle. The corporal conducted a computer query on the vehicle’s registration and determined that the driver’s license of the registered owner was suspended. The corporal, who was a veteran officer with nearly 12 years of law enforcement experience, activated his emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle. Both the corporal and the probation officer were wearing body armor and black utility uniforms with the words “police” and “probation officer” on them. The corporal determined that the driver of the vehicle was the registered owner and directed him to exit the vehicle. The corporal advised the driver that his license was suspended, and his vehicle was going to be inventoried and towed. The driver asked to retrieve an item from his vehicle and quickly reentered his car. The corporal followed the driver to his car and reached through the driver’s side door, across the driver, to remove the keys from the ignition. As the corporal was standing beside the vehicle with his head and upper torso inside, the driver put the manual stick shift into gear and pressed the accelerator. The corporal was dragged 15 feet, which caused injuries to the front of both legs/feet, specifically his knees. The driver attempted to remove the corporal from the vehicle, but the corporal wrestled with the driver, took the vehicle out of gear, and gained control of the steering wheel. The corporal removed the driver from the vehicle and took him into custody with the probation officer’s help. A search of the vehicle yielded pills and more than $2,000 in cash. The 31-year-old driver was charged with Second- Degree Assault, Intentionally Injuring a Law Enforcement Officer, Resisting Arrest with Force, and Violence That Injures/Struggles with a Peace Officer. His criminal history included resisting arrest, a drug law violation, and a violent crime.
