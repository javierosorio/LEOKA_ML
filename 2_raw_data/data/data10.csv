"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290
"A 30-year-old patrol officer with the Sandusky Police Department was shot and killed on March 19 while attempting to make a traffic stop. Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence. After a standoff of several hours, SWAT officers arrested the alleged shooter without further incident. He was charged with Murder.",196
"On August 12 around 3:40 p.m., a 33-year-old patrol officer with the Hatch Police Department was fatally wounded while making a traffic stop. The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects. The 38-year-old man who allegedly shot the victim officer was charged with Murder, Possession of a Firearm, Firing Weapon, and Carjacking.

"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

He had a previous criminal record that included drug violations, violent crime, and weapons violations.",1124
"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene.

"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected.

"A 39-year-old officer with the Merced Police Department (MPD) was shot during a traffic pursuit and stop on February 28 at approximately 2:30 a.m. The officer, along with another MPD officer, had arrived on the scene of a traffic stop involving two men. Just prior to the officers’ arrival, the driver of the vehicle had failed to immediately stop when officers had signaled him to do so, and assistance had been requested.

"A 43-year-old veteran sergeant with the Fort Worth Police Department (FWPD), who had more than 18 years of law enforcement experience, survived a premeditated ambush at 7 p.m. on January 29. About 6:15 p.m., the FWPD received several 911 calls in reference to an audible panic alarm at a residence. Because one of the individuals at the residence had been involved in a prior aggravated assault with a firearm, the FWPD’s computer-aided dispatch system sent an automatic hazardous location notification to officers. The officer who responded to the call checked the exterior of the residence and did not see anything unusual. The officer returned to his vehicle to wait for backup. Two sergeants, riding together, arrived to assist. The officer and two sergeants walked to the front door and spoke to the homeowner who said she wasn’t sure why the panic alarm was going off. She indicated she and her son were the only ones in the house, and no assistance was needed from the police department. She reported she would attempt to get the alarm turned off. The officers left the residence and returned to their usual duties. Around 6:45 p.m., FWPD dispatch received a 911 call from the same homeowner who reported that her 40-year-old son had locked himself in his bedroom, and she was unable to make contact with him. She was concerned her son may be having a medical emergency, and she was unable to open his bedroom door to check his condition. Four police officers and an ambulance were dispatched to the residence. The two sergeants who had responded to the earlier call volunteered to return to the residence. Once again, dispatch issued an automatic hazardous location notification. In addition, one of the responding officers informed the other officers that he also had knowledge of prior incidents at the residence involving the homeowner’s son. The two sergeants and four officers arrived at the residence shortly before 7 p.m. in fully marked patrol vehicles wearing standard police uniforms. The ambulance parked away from the residence and awaited notification that it was safe to approach. Two officers and a sergeant stayed in the front yard while the veteran sergeant and two of the officers walked to the front door of the residence. The homeowner met them there and repeated the situation involving her son to the officers. When officers asked her if her son had any weapons, the homeowner responded she was not aware of any. The homeowner led the veteran sergeant and the two officers to her son’s bedroom and knocked on the closed door. She called her son’s name, but he did not respond. One of the officers went outside the residence and looked through the bedroom window to check on the man’s condition. She was unable to see anything through the window, and then remained outside with the sergeant and two officers stationed in the front yard. Back inside the residence, the remaining officer knocked loudly on the man’s bedroom door, while the veteran sergeant announced that they were police officers and asked the man to open the door. The man did not respond, so the officer forced the door open with his knee. The sergeant and the officer could see the man lying on the bed across the room, covered with a bed sheet. The man asked the officers, “What’s going on?” As the sergeant began to tell the man why the officers were there, the man fired four rounds at the officers from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The veteran sergeant was standing just outside the bedroom doorway, and at least two of the rounds struck him in the front below the waist and in the arms/hands. The other officer returned fire and justifiably killed the suspect. The suspect, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime. The injured veteran sergeant survived his injuries and later returned to duty.",1097
"At 11:30 p.m. on September 28, a corporal with the Waynesboro Police Department was killed by a shotgun blast after he initiated a traffic stop.

"Shortly before 6 a.m. on March 20, two patrol officers with the Fond du Lac Police Department were shot, one of them killed, in an unprovoked attack while investigating a report of sexual assault. The 28-year-old officer who was killed had nearly 2 years of law enforcement experience, and the 33-year-old veteran officer who was assaulted and injured had more than 9 years of experience. Around 5:45 a.m., a 911 call came in reporting a sexual assault. The victim had left her residence where she said the attack occurred. She explained that the offender was her ex-boyfriend and landlord, and they lived in a side-by-side duplex, with entry to both sides through the basement. The victim was worried about her young child and believed the offender might harm the child as a result of her report. Several officers, including the 33-year-old officer, went to search the victim’s home. After searching the home and not finding anyone, officers decided to search the offender’s side of the duplex out of concern for the child. The officers announced themselves from the basement and then searched the first floor of the offender’s home without incident. They found the staircase to the second floor and again identified themselves as police. As the officers were walking up the L-shaped stairway, the suspect began firing on them with a .308-caliber semiautomatic rifle, hitting the 33-year-old officer twice in the chest, penetrating his body armor. He fell onto the officers behind him and was helped out of the residence. He was taken by ambulance to a local hospital for treatment of his injuries. Officers called for backup and several more law enforcement professionals arrived, including the 28-year-old officer. The officer parked at an intersection northeast of the offender’s duplex, exited his squad car, and walked along the wall of a bar located within view of the offender’s location. The offender fired the same rifle from his home more than 50 feet away, hitting the officer in the stomach. When the officer fell forward with his head raised, the offender fired a second bullet. This bullet exceeded the specifications of the officer’s body armor and entered the top of his vest, fatally wounding the 28-year-old officer in the chest. The officer died at the scene. The 30-year-old offender, who had a history of violent crime, drug violations, and police assault, continued to shoot at officers and squad cars surrounding the scene and eventually committed suicide.",1203
"A patrol officer with the Freemansburg Police Department was killed while responding to a disturbance call just after 5 p.m. on August 11. The 31-year-old patrol officer, who had more than 9 years of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to a neighborhood dispute. Shortly after arriving, he requested backup. The assisting officer arrived to find the veteran patrol officer using his electronic control device (ECD) to hold off two dogs that were poised to attack him. The assisting officer instructed the patrol officer to shoot the dogs with the ECD. Immediately, the patrol officer, who was wearing body armor, was struck in the back of his head by a blast from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, and he fell to the ground. The assisting officer then spotted the assailant who had been standing in close proximity of the victim officer but just outside of the assisting officer’s view. Apparently, the assailant’s weapon had jammed after the blast. The assisting officer repeatedly ordered the assailant to drop his weapon and surrender. Eventually, the assailant complied and was taken into custody. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The 46-year-old assailant, who had a prior criminal record including drug violations and weapons violations, was charged with Criminal Homicide.

"A 42-year-old auxiliary deputy with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office (JCSO) was shot and fatally wounded on May 15 while investigating a burglary in progress. Shortly after 1 a.m., the veteran auxiliary deputy, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, responded with a JCSO deputy to a residence where a break-in had been reported. A JCSO lieutenant detective in the area heard about the burglary over the radio and was also on his way to the scene. Just before the auxiliary deputy and the deputy arrived at the driveway to the residence, they discovered an unoccupied truck parked off the road behind a gate. They noticed the truck had a flat tire, the hood was warm, and the keys were still inside. The deputy and detective discussed the situation over the radio and requested that dispatch run the truck’s license plate number to identify the owner. They also requested assistance from two JCSO dog handlers and their tracking dog. About this time, the deputies encountered the owner of the residence near the entrance to his driveway. The owner explained that someone had broken the glass in the back door of his residence, and he was concerned that the intruder may still be inside. The homeowner also informed the deputies that some of his possessions were in a ditch outside the residence. The detective arrived at the scene, and he and the deputies quickly developed a strategy. The detective positioned himself near the parked truck in order to apprehend the truck owner if he returned. The deputies cleared the residence. As the deputies finished their search and determined the residence was unoccupied, the tracking team arrived. The tracking dog obtained the intruder’s scent from the items located in the ditch, and the tracking team set off with the auxiliary deputy to search for the subject. The deputy stayed behind to collect and log evidence from the scene of the break-in. At 2:20 a.m., the auxiliary deputy contacted the detective on the police radio and advised him that he and the tracking team had followed the suspect’s trail into a field, and they believed that the trail was leading back to the location of the truck. Around 2:30 a.m., the auxiliary deputy radioed the detective a second time and advised that the pace of the pursuit had increased and repeated that the suspect’s trail still appeared to be leading directly back to the truck. During the foot pursuit, the suspect fired five rounds from a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle toward the auxiliary deputy, who returned fire, but did not hit the suspect. One of the rounds struck the auxiliary deputy above his body armor. The deputy who had processed the burglary scene heard the gunfire and drove to the area where the auxiliary deputy and the tracking team were located. The deputy found the suspect (who was later determined to be the owner of the abandoned truck) behind a tree on a hill. The deputy yelled for the suspect to come out, and the suspect began crawling down the hill. The deputy drew his service weapon and approached the suspect, ordered him to put his hands out, and handcuffed the suspect’s hands behind his back. He guided the suspect to a ditch and took cover in case there were additional suspects hiding in the woods. Around this time, the detective called for emergency medical services (EMS), reporting that an officer was down. After determining there were no other suspects hiding, the deputy left his cover and located the auxiliary deputy on the ground with a gunshot wound to the front upper torso/chest. He did not have a pulse; the deputy and a member of the tracking team started CPR and continued until EMS arrived. The auxiliary deputy was transported via ambulance and then helicopter to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries that same day. The 51- year-old suspect, who had no prior criminal record, was charged with Capital Murder, two counts of Attempted Capital Murder, and Residential Burglary.",393

Two deputies were dispatched to a residence where a neighbor had reported an altercation. Upon arriving, the deputies found an intoxicated female in the street in front of the residence. The female presented her injuries and appeared to be the victim of the reported domestic incident. One of the deputies, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 9 years of experience, left the female victim with the backup deputy and approached the residence. The backup deputy moved to a better position near the driveway where he observed the first deputy moving hastily backward from the residence and shouting, “Don’t!” Shots were fired, and the suspect then exited the house, naked and armed with a .357-caliber revolver. The victim deputy, who was wearing body armor, returned fire and shot the suspect in the center of his body, grazing the suspect’s hand and the gun in his hand.

The deputy, who had 3 months of law enforcement experience, was one of two deputies who responded to a call to assist emergency medical services (EMS) personnel treating an unconscious woman lying in the front yard of a residence in Mineral Point. When the two deputies arrived, they observed a paramedic and a woman attempting to aid the unconscious woman. The paramedic told the deputies a man at the scene ran into the nearby wood line when they arrived; the woman assisting the paramedic reported the man was her brother. After the deputies helped load the patient into the ambulance, the other woman began walking towards her residence. As the deputies followed her to gather additional information about the unconscious woman, a gunshot was fired from in front of them. The deputy at the rear took cover by the driver’s side of the patrol vehicle, but the deputy behind the woman fell to the ground. Realizing his colleague had been shot, the other deputy advised the EMS personnel to stay in the ambulance and radioed dispatch to report shots had been fired and an officer was down. The deputy tried to locate the shooter when a second gunshot knocked the driver’s side rear-view mirror off of the patrol vehicle. He ducked and heard another gunshot that shattered the passenger side window. He then observed two officers with the Potosi Police Department moving toward his location. The woman, who had run into the woods to talk to her brother after the first gunshot, came to the side of the patrol vehicle and told the deputy that her brother was the shooter. She said she had tried to physically take the firearm away from him, but was unsuccessful. She also reported her brother had previously dug holes in the wooded area to hide in the event someone was looking for him. During this time, one of the officers moved to the victim deputy and dragged him to the driver’s side of the patrol vehicle.

"On January 13 around 2 a.m., a 44-year-old Birmingham Police Department (BPD) sergeant was killed and a 27-year-old BPD police officer was injured while answering a call for service regarding two subjects tampering with vehicles. The incident was captured on a body camera worn by the 27-year-old officer. Shortly before the incident, a plain-clothed officer called for backup after he observed the subjects attempting to enter parked vehicles by pulling on door handles. Three uniformed officers in body armor, including the sergeant and the 27-year-old officer, arrived at the scene and made contact with the subjects, now seated in their own vehicle. The officers smelled burnt marijuana and observed an open container of alcohol in the vehicle. The sergeant, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 21 years of experience, removed the front-seat passenger from the vehicle and handcuffed him. The other two officers removed the second subject from the driver’s seat of the vehicle, patted him down, and found a substance they believed to be marijuana in his right front pants pocket. The two officers attempted to handcuff the subject, but he struggled with them. During the altercation, he drew a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his waistband and fired one round, which struck the sergeant, who was standing on the other side of the vehicle, in the front of his head. The offender continued to fire his weapon and struggle with the two other officers. In all, the offender fired eight rounds. One of the uniformed officers disengaged from the offender, drew her duty weapon, and fired three rounds at the offender, striking him and causing him to drop to the ground and cease struggling. During the altercation, the 27-year-old officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience, was shot in the front upper torso/chest, rear upper torso/back, rear lower torso/back, and front lower torso/abdomen. Although the victim officer was wearing body armor, he was injured when a round entered his vest through the armhole/shoulder area.

"A deputy sheriff with the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) was gunned down while investigating a suspicious person at 4:14 a.m., on January 8 in Anthem. About 25 minutes earlier, another deputy responded to a burglary alarm at a business, where he found a smashed window and an open door. The 50-year-old deputy, a veteran with more than 20 years’ law enforcement experience, was one of three deputies who arrived about 10 minutes later to assist. After clearing the inside of the office, three of the deputies began talking to a business representative who had come to the scene. The fourth deputy began searching the parking lot area to the east and south of the business and observed a minivan with an Illinois license plate. A check of the plate through the MCSO dispatch revealed the vehicle was registered to an Illinois resident and had not been reported stolen. One of the deputies approached the vehicle and observed a man inside lying on his back under a blanket on a mattress with his head towards the rear of the minivan. The veteran deputy then drove his patrol vehicle within 15-20 feet of the driver’s side of the minivan with his emergency lights activated. The deputy exited his patrol vehicle and approached the driver’s side sliding door of the minivan while the other deputy took a position to the rear of the vehicle. When the deputy knocked on the window, the man inside sat up and put his hand on the door trim inside. Although the deputy announced the presence of law enforcement and gave numerous commands for the man to show his hands, the man forcefully opened the sliding door, turned toward the deputy and began firing a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle, striking him in the right arm/hand and in the front lower torso/stomach below his body armor. The victim deputy managed to move himself away from the direct line of fire to a nearby curb as the other deputy returned fire with his service weapon. An exchange of gunfire ensued between the two, during which the deputy reloaded, returned fire, and struck the suspect. The two deputies at the burglary scene responded, one on foot (as he notified dispatch of shots fired) and the other in his patrol vehicle. Both deputies responding to the gunshots did so directly into the suspect’s line of fire. The deputy onsite reloaded a second time and continued exchanging gunfire with the suspect until the suspect fell from the minivan’s sliding door and onto the ground. The man regained his grip on his weapon and resumed firing at all three deputies. The deputy who responded on foot joined the deputy at the rear of the minivan and engaged the suspect with his service weapon as both commanded the suspect to “let go of the gun.” Ultimately, the suspect released the weapon and one of the deputies approached and kicked the rifle away from him. As that deputy covered the suspect, the other two deputies began performing CPR on the victim deputy and advised dispatch an officer was down. Emergency fire and medical personnel responded, as well as other surrounding law enforcement officers. The victim deputy was transported to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to the injuries sustained in the incident. The 30-year-old suspect, who had a criminal history with a prior conviction, was pronounced dead at the scene, justifiably killed by law enforcement. An investigation of the individual revealed he had murdered two people in Sedona two days earlier with the same weapon he had used during this incident.",507

The veteran agent, who had more than 5 years of law enforcement experience, was part of the Chaves County Metro Narcotics Task Force (CCMNTF). Agents with the CCMNTF, along with the FBI, were conducting a long-term investigation of a drug trafficking organization. Agents received information that the main subject of the investigation had arranged to meet an unknown methamphetamine supplier from Arizona in the parking lot of a restaurant in Roswell. Agents also learned that another individual, a close associate of the main subject, had traveled to Albuquerque with the subject earlier that morning. According to the information, the pair would be returning to Roswell later in the evening to acquire the methamphetamine from the supplier. Because of information gleaned from their long-term investigation, the agents had prior knowledge that the associate of the main subject reportedly possessed multiple firearms and was a heavy methamphetamine user. While traveling to the restaurant, the agents spotted the subject and his associate at a gas station. The agents continued to the meeting place and set up surveillance in and around the restaurant’s parking lot. Eventually, the vehicles belonging to both the subject and the supplier arrived. The main subject who arranged the meeting exited his vehicle and approached the supplier’s vehicle. Multiple agents approached both vehicles on foot, made verbal contact with the subject and the supplier, and ordered the associate, who was in the passenger seat of the subject’s vehicle, to show his hands. By this time, the associate already had his car door open and, without warning, fired two rounds from a .45-caliber revolver in the direction of the agents located at the rear of the vehicle. The second round struck the victim agent, who was wearing body armor, in the front lower torso/stomach. The victim agent fired two rounds from his service weapon at the suspect before falling to the ground; however, both rounds missed the suspect. Other agents fired into the front passenger area of the vehicle, striking and justifiably killing the suspect.

"Shortly after 5 a.m. on July 2, a 29-year-old trooper with the New York State Police (NYSP) was fatally injured during a tactical situation following a check on the welfare of a subject. Around 3 a.m., NYSP troopers responded to a residence in Erwin where a subject was threatening to shoot himself. The troopers checked the home, found nothing unusual, and departed. A short time later, the troopers located the subject as he was driving back toward the residence. They followed the subject and witnessed him entering the house. The troopers attempted to communicate with the subject but got no response. The trooper, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner arrived at the residence along with deputies from the Steuben County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO); they took up perimeter positions outside the home. Around 4:45 a.m., the subject broke a window from the rear of the house and fired at the troopers with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun.

The NYSP Special Operations Response Team and the SCSO SWAT team arrived and entered the home. They discovered the 42-year-old subject, who had no prior arrests or judicial history, had committed suicide. Investigators suspected the incident may have been a case of suicide-by-cop. A postmortem examination revealed one round from law enforcement struck the subject in the torso causing an injury that may have been fatal had the subject not shot himself in the moments after he was justifiably shot by law enforcement.",176

The officer could not reach his firearm because of the way the offender had positioned himself. The offender grabbed the officer's firearm but could not pull  it from the holster due to the holster's retention-level safety features.

The dispatcher provided the subject’s name and description of the vehicle, which was parked in front of the store. The officer knew the subject from previous law enforcement contacts and was aware from recent morning briefings that law enforcement had banned the subject from the store premises. Upon his arrival at the store, the officer observed the subject standing next to his vehicle. When the subject saw the officer, he got into his vehicle and locked all the doors. A store employee pointed at the subject and identified him as the man who had stolen coffee. The officer approached the subject’s vehicle and asked him to open the window; the subject rolled the window down about an inch. The officer noticed a half-full mug of steaming coffee in the passenger seat. When the officer asked why the subject had stolen the coffee, he replied, “Because I can.” The subject admitted he had been asked to leave the property earlier the same morning. When the officer informed the subject he was trespassing, he replied with phrases such as “just shoot me then,” “suicide by cop,” and “pull the trigger.” The subject rolled up the window and turned up the volume of the radio. The officer asked the subject to exit the vehicle several times, but he refused.

The 51- year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, told the subject that he was under arrest and ordered him to exit his vehicle several times, but the subject did not comply. The officers observed the subject pretending to shave his beard with a knife and then actually cutting his neck. Because the subject was a danger to himself, the 51-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, broke the front passenger side window, opened the door, and entered through it. The second assisting officer got into the car through the same door and unsuccessfully attempted to unlock the driver’s side door. Meanwhile, the 51-year-old officer wrestled the subject for the knife and repeatedly ordered him to drop the weapon. The original responding officer went to the passenger side and fired his electronic control device, which struck the offender in the upper right shoulder but had little effect. The second assisting officer unlocked the driver’s side door, so the original responding officer went back to that side of the vehicle, removed the subject from the car, and placed him in handcuffs. The subject had three 2- inch cuts on his left hand and abrasions on the right side of his neck, so the officers requested medical transport for him. During the struggle, the 51-year-old officer suffered a 1-inch cut on his left thumb. He was transported to a local hospital where he received six stitches and was released. The injured officer has since returned to duty. The 45-year- old offender was charged with Trespassing, Shoplifting, Obstruct/Resist Executive Officer, and Resisting Arrest.

"On July 31, a 46-year-old patrol officer with the California Highway Patrol (CHP), Placerville, died as the result of injuries sustained in a high-speed traffic pursuit that began at 12:22 p.m. in Rancho Cordova. Dispatched to a parked vehicle with an unresponsive driver lying inside, officers with the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) attempted to get identification from the driver. However, the man fled from the scene in the vehicle, and a pursuit ensued reaching speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour.

"A 38-year-old corporal with the West Virginia State Police (WVSP) was wounded after responding to a reported domestic altercation on March 28 at an apartment in Alum Creek. Neighbors had reported hearing disturbances at one of the apartments. One caller, who had left the apartment, reported a man was choking and verbally abusing his girlfriend. Other reports stated there was a rifle in the apartment’s kitchen, and the subject was very aggressive and allegedly under the influence of narcotics. The corporal, a veteran of law enforcement with 15 years of experience, responded to these reports at approximately 2 a.m. The corporal arrived at the residence and found the door to the apartment was open. When he looked inside, a woman, covered in blood, was standing in the kitchen. Upon entering the apartment, the corporal announced his presence and immediately saw the subject emerging from a bedroom holding a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle and a .38-caliber handgun. The corporal drew his .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and instructed the man to put down his weapons. The subject did not comply with the request and fired three rounds from the rifle. Two rounds struck the corporal at close range, one round struck his arms/hands in his left wrist, and one round penetrated his body armor in the front upper torso/chest. Despite his injury, the corporal fired eight rounds, but none struck the offender. The corporal retreated from the apartment and collapsed on an outside deck. The corporal realized that he wasn’t able to move his hand and he could not reload his firearm. He instructed the female victim to run because he could no longer help due to his injuries. The corporal radioed 911 to report shots fired and provided details of his injuries. He also informed 911 that the female victim was out of the residence, but her current whereabouts were unknown. The corporal told dispatchers that he was leaving the area to receive medical attention for his injuries and requested emergency medical service to meet him. Several law enforcement agencies from a nearby county met him, and an ambulance transported him to a local hospital. Other agencies responded to the apartment, including the WVSP Special Response Team and a Kanawha County SWAT Team. Upon arrival, two state police law enforcement officers were assessing the situation when the suspect fired at them through a window in the residence. As a precaution, law enforcement evacuated the apartment building. The subject barricaded himself in the bathroom, and negotiations were unsuccessful. Power was shut off to the building, and law enforcement used a remote-controlled bomb disposal robot with lights and cameras to enter the residence to monitor the situation and possibly communicate with the suspect. The robot maneuvered through the residence and located the subject in the bathtub. The robot secured and removed a rifle found on the bathroom floor before two officers entered the residence. The officers used a flash bang device as a distraction before entering the very small bathroom to apprehend the subject. While trying to subdue the subject, he became physically combative and attempted to gain control of one of the officer’s rifles. The subject continued to resist and the officers physically removed him from the bathroom. Two additional officers assisted and the officers eventually handcuffed and arrested the offender. During the struggle, one officer received a bloody nose and the other received a cut to his forehead. The suspect and both officers were taken to local hospitals, where the officers were treated and released. The female victim was eventually located and transported to the hospital for medical attention for injuries sustained in the domestic disturbance.

"On January 6, a trooper with the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP), Memphis, was shot and killed while conducting a vehicle stop in Covington. Just before 9:30 p.m., the 24-year-old trooper, with nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, approached the driver’s side door of the stopped vehicle, which had two occupants.

About 4 a.m. the next day, a vehicle matching the description was stopped and the individuals were transported to the local jail. While in jail, these individuals revealed that they had transported two males to a motel in Nashville. Apparently, the information that the individuals gave to the police implicated the two men in the murder of the victim trooper. The Nashville Metro SWAT Team and THP Special Operations Unit descended on that location and arrested the two suspects, a 17-year-old who was on probation at the time of the incident, and a 19-year- old with no prior criminal record.

"A 36-year-old police officer with the Baltimore County Police Department was severely injured in Dundalk on June 7 while answering a call for service. Witnesses reported that the suspect from an armed robbery had fled the street where it occurred and boarded a mass transit bus. After locating the bus around 3 p.m., the officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 13 years’ experience, conducted a stop and boarded the bus. When the officer approached the suspect, the man produced a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and began firing at her. The officer, who was wearing body armor, took cover in the rear stairwell of the bus and drew her service weapon. The suspect continued shooting at the officer, and she exited the bus’s rear door. The suspect then ordered the passengers to leave the bus, and they hastily departed. Additional officers arrived on scene and positioned their vehicles near the front and rear entrances of the bus. The suspect eventually got off the bus displaying two handguns, one in each hand. He began shooting at officers who were taking cover behind their vehicles. Four of the responding officers returned gunfire. The officer who had initially arrived on the scene had taken cover behind a vehicle at the rear of the bus. The suspect fired additional shots at the officer, one of which struck her in her front legs/feet. The suspect took cover behind a vehicle parallel to the bus, then continued shooting as he ran to a nearby yard. Responding officers fired multiple rounds, striking the suspect. He died at the scene. The 35-year-old suspect was known to possess controlled substances and to have previously suffered with a mental illness. He had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, a drug law violation, and a weapons violation.

"A 44-year-old senior trooper with the Louisiana State Police in Lake Charles was shot around 3 p.m. on August 23 in Bell City while investigating suspicious persons or circumstances. At 2:35 p.m. the veteran trooper, who had more than 20 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a 911 call advising there was a truck in the ditch at an intersection. When the trooper arrived, he made contact with the vehicle’s passenger who claimed the driver had left on foot an hour prior to the trooper’s arrival. The trooper, who was wearing body armor, requested a tow truck to recover the vehicle from the ditch. During the interaction, the alleged passenger produced a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and fired at the trooper, striking him in the front of the head. Passing motorists who saw the situation stopped to assist. Just as 911 dispatch was advising officers that a trooper was down, a civilian used the trooper’s radio to report that a trooper was down with head trauma, and the suspected gunman had tried to take the trooper’s weapon. A minute later the civilian advised that “they had the suspected shooter in custody.” Another trooper responded to the scene and requested air transport for the victim trooper. The trooper died the next day from the gunshot wound he sustained.

The veteran trooper, who had more than 13½ years of law enforcement service, had pulled over a vehicle for a traffic violation along an interstate near Chenango. He parked his patrol unit behind the stopped car and walked to the driver’s side window to talk to the driver. Suddenly, a truck headed in the same direction on the interstate, traveling at approximately 90 miles per hour, swerved to the right, sideswiped the vehicle, and struck the trooper. The trooper was killed instantly. His body became lodged in the truck’s framework, and the driver continued off the roadway.

"A 48-year-old trooper with the Texas Highway Patrol was seriously injured on April 6 at 8:42 p.m. while responding to a two-vehicle traffic crash in Edinburg. The trooper, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the crash scene where witnesses told him that one of the drivers had just left the scene on foot. The trooper located the subject three blocks away, running on the sidewalk. The trooper drove up alongside the subject and parked. As the trooper exited his vehicle, the subject, who was under the influence of alcohol, pulled a .357-caliber revolver from his waistband. Both the trooper and the subject opened fire almost simultaneously from a distance of 15 feet. The trooper fired five rounds but did not hit the suspect. The suspect fired six rounds.

"A 43-year-old sergeant with the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office and a 40-year-old Assistant Special Agent in Charge with Immigration and Customs Enforcement were killed on March 11 in the Atlanta area. Just before 9 a.m. inside a local courthouse, a deputy was escorting an inmate, who was being retried on charges of Rape, Aggravated Sodomy, Burglary, False Imprisonment, and Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, from a detention area to a holding area. Once inside the holding area, the deputy removed the man’s handcuffs so he could change into civilian clothes for his court appearance. After the deputy removed a handcuff from one hand, the man lunged at her, severely beat her, and took her empty gun belt and keys. He used the keys to open the lockbox holding the unconscious deputy’s service weapon and took the .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. He went into a judge’s office at the courthouse and ordered several people into the judge’s chambers. The escapee then captured the officer who provided courtroom security for the judge, took his handgun, handcuffed him, and put him in a restroom. Moments later, the escapee reportedly entered the judge’s courtroom and fatally shot the judge and a court stenographer. The officer who had been in the restroom managed to escape and used his radio to broadcast that an officer needed help. The escapee then fled on foot down several flights of stairs. As he emerged from the building, he encountered the Fulton County sergeant, who had 18 years of law enforcement experience. He shot the sergeant once in the stomach with a .40-caliber service weapon, fatally wounding him. He then ran into a nearby parking garage and carjacked four different vehicles at gunpoint. After he parked the fourth car on the basement floor of the parking garage, the escapee ran to the nearby train station and took the train to a different area of town, where he remained until it was dark. Apparently, at 11:30 p.m., the escapee located and entered a house that was under construction. Once inside the house, which belonged to a federal agent, he encountered the agent who was on the premises working on the home. The agent, who had nearly 19 years of law enforcement experience, identified himself as law enforcement and displayed a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun as he questioned the escapee about his identity and why he was in the agent’s home. During the questioning, the escapee pulled out a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and shot the agent at close range in the arms and hands and fatally in the lower rib cage. He then took items belonging to the victim agent, including his weapon, money, and keys, before leaving the scene in the agent’s truck. Evidently, the escapee used the victim agent’s truck to drive to another county, where he forced his way into an apartment in Duluth about 2 a.m. on March 12. A woman living in the apartment was returning home at that time when the suspect confronted her and forced her to open the door and let him in. He bound the woman and held her at gunpoint for almost 8 hours. Approximately 9:50 that morning, the woman talked the man into allowing her to leave the apartment to see her child. She left the apartment and called 911. The Gwinnett County Police Department and the FBI responded, and the 33-year-old escapee, who had prior convictions for violent crime, drugs, and weapons violations, was taken into custody without incident about 10:30 a.m. He was arrested and charged with Murder, Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, and Obstruction of a Law Enforcement Officer. The victim agent’s possessions were recovered following the man’s arrest. At the time this publication was compiled, the injured deputy had not returned to duty and was continuing to receive medical care for the injuries she received in the incident.",411
"On March 5, a 31-year-old police officer with the Philadelphia Police Department was shot and killed during a robbery in progress at a retail location around 4:40 p.m. The officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 9 years of experience, was in the store shopping when two men wearing masks entered with guns and announced a robbery. When the suspects realized a uniformed officer was in the store, they started shooting, and the officer returned fire. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was struck with rounds from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. He suffered wounds in the front upper torso/chest, the rear upper torso/back (by rounds that entered the armhole/shoulder area of the vest), the rear below the waist, the arms/hands, and the front of his head. The suspects attempted to escape out the back door of the store, but it was locked. The 29-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time and had a criminal history that included a violent crime and a weapons violation, fled the store through the front door. Upon exiting the building, he engaged in gunfire with responding officers until he was shot in the leg and apprehended. The 24-year-old suspect, who also had a criminal history, had thrown his weapon behind the register and was attempting to blend in with the employees and customers before being arrested. Both suspects were charged with Murder, Possessing an Instrument of Crime, Criminal Conspiracy, Recklessly Endangering Another Person, Robbery, Violation of the Uniform Firearms Act–Former Convict, and No License on the Street.

"Around 10:20 p.m. on October 1, a 44-year-old corporal with the Lafayette Police Department was shot and killed in an ambush (entrapment/premeditation) when he responded to a report of shots fired. The veteran corporal, who had more than 9 years of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to a convenience store where two people had been shot by an unknown person.

"Two deputy sheriffs, both aged 44, with the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office were shot and killed while attempting to make an arrest in Crestview around 12:50 p.m. on April 25. About 10:20 a.m., other deputies from the same office responded to a local hospital regarding a report of domestic violence. The victim told the deputies that her husband had beaten her, and she gave the officers a description of his truck and also indicated that she believed he would be at their apartment or at a local shooting range. Around noon, the victim deputies, both of whom were wearing body armor, located the suspect’s truck at the shooting range and saw the man standing behind the truck. The deputies, who were driving separate patrol cars, parked several feet behind the truck with the patrol cars facing opposite directions. Witnesses said the deputies approached the man and ordered him to get on the ground, but the man refused. As the deputies continued to give the man commands to get on the ground, one of the deputies pulled out a conducted energy device (CED). When the man continued to defy their orders, the deputy used the CED. The man fell to the ground, then immediately pulled out a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and began shooting at the deputies. One of the deputies took cover at the front of one of the cruisers, and the assailant positioned himself at the back of the same cruiser. In an exchange of gunfire, the deputy at the front of the cruiser was hit in the shoulder. Despite the injury, the deputy (whose total years of law enforcement experience is unknown) was able to notify dispatchers that he was shot, and he continued to exchange gunfire. The shooter stepped away from the vehicle, approached the injured deputy, and shot him in the front of the head. The second deputy, who had more than 22 years of law enforcement experience, had taken cover but was out of view of any witnesses. At one point, someone at the shooting range saw the second deputy move to the back of the truck, and he attempted to take cover by jumping into the open passenger side door of the assailant’s vehicle. Witnesses then heard gunshots and saw the window from the open door shatter. The assailant walked around his truck and shut the passenger side door. He then walked around to the driver’s side, got in, and sped off on a local highway. A short time later, additional deputies arrived at the scene and found the two victim deputies lying on the ground. They were transported to a local hospital where they both died later that day. The first deputy succumbed to the gunshot wound to the front of his head, and the second deputy succumbed to the gunshot wound to the rear of his head. Dispatchers broadcast a description of the man’s truck to local law enforcement. A sergeant from the Walton County Sheriff’s Office, traveling on the same highway, spotted the truck and attempted to make a traffic stop, but the man refused to stop. The sergeant pursued the vehicle as additional officers deployed spike strips in an attempt to disable the truck in a couple of locations along the highway. However, the suspect avoided the strips and continued to flee at speeds of up to 80 mph. A police officer from the Defuniak Springs Police Department placed a set of spike strips across the road along the highway at the city limits. The suspect saw the spike strips and turned across all lanes of the highway to avoid them. He drove off of the right shoulder of the highway and headed toward the sergeant. The sergeant pulled out his gun and fired at the driver’s window as the suspect sped past him going about 70 mph. At this point, five patrol units from Walton County and one unit from Okaloosa County were in pursuit. As the suspect’s vehicle crossed the entrance road to a local airport, it went airborne and left the roadway. The suspect attempted to gain control of the truck and return to the road when the sergeant from Walton County performed a tactical maneuver in an attempt to end the pursuit. The maneuver forced the suspect’s truck off of the right shoulder of the roadway where the truck struck a sign and some shrubs. The vehicle then flipped several times and struck the roof and windshield of a vehicle driven by a Walton County sheriff’s deputy before coming to rest up against that deputy’s vehicle. The remaining deputies involved in the pursuit positioned their vehicles around the suspect’s truck. The suspect, still in the vehicle, shot at the deputies, who returned fire and killed the assailant to end the threat. The 28-year-old man had a prior criminal record that included violent crime.",1032

"Two officers were killed and one officer was injured while investigating suspicious persons on August 2. Around 4:20 p.m., three officers from the Rapid City Police Department who were on patrol received information that persons were drinking alcohol while walking down the street. A 38-year-old police officer  with 4 years of experience arrived in a marked police unit and made contact with four individuals. Minutes later, a 27-year-old patrol officer with 3 years of law enforcement experience arrived on a bicycle and a 28-year-old police officer with 6 years of law enforcement experience arrived in a marked police unit. During the initial contact, three of the individuals cooperated, and the officers were able to confirm their identities. These individuals were told they were free to leave. The patrol officer was standing next to the fourth individual who was being uncooperative, providing false information, and had an open container with alcohol. Minutes later, the suspect pulled a concealed .357-magnum revolver from his waist area and began shooting at the officers. He first shot the 27-year-old officer fatally in the front upper torso/chest, just left of his body armor, immediately incapacitating him. He aimed next at the 38-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, and shot him in the face. This officer was able to recover and fire one round before falling back to the ground. The suspect then moved toward the 28-year-old veteran officer. During this exchange of gunfire, the officer was able to return fire and shot 14 rounds from his .40-caliber handgun before collapsing in the street from a fatal shot to his front upper torso/chest just left of his body armor. The 22-year-old suspect, who was incapacitated during the shooting, was struck twice and later died from his injuries. He had an extensive criminal record including police assault. It was later determined that he was under the influence of narcotics and alcohol at the time of the incident.",1207
"A deputy sheriff, aged 32, with the Adams County Sheriff’s Office was killed when he responded to a disturbance call shortly before 11 a.m. on March 7 in Strongs Prairie. The 7- year veteran responded to a call that an individual was threatening road workers with a firearm. Additional deputies had been dispatched but had not yet arrived. Arriving at the scene, the officer saw the man standing in his driveway and attempted to talk to the individual. Apparently, the person then reached into brush lining the driveway and produced a .300-caliber lever-action rifle with a scope. The officer unholstered his .45- caliber semiautomatic handgun, pointed it at the man, and commanded him several times to drop his weapon, but the individual continued to raise the rifle. The deputy fired two shots, missing the man. The suspect allegedly then fired a single shot from a distance of more than 50 feet, fatally striking the deputy in the front upper torso. The victim officer, who died at the scene, was wearing body armor; however, the round was more powerful than the vest’s capabilities. After shooting the victim officer, the 54- year- old man, who was known to have prior mental disorders, took the deputy’s service weapon and radio and barricaded himself inside his residence. Following a 6-hour standoff with law enforcement officers, tactical unit members took the suspect into custody. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Intentional Homicide.",516

The officer, who had nearly 20 years of law enforcement experience, was processing the scene of an earlier burglary at a local garage. After taking photographs of the scene and dusting for fingerprints, the officer was standing at the back of his police vehicle wearing his protective vest when a man apparently approached him from behind and fatally shot him in the side of the head with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The offender then allegedly shot the owner of the garage in the head and attempted to move evidence regarding the earlier burglary of the garage.

"On April 27 at 2:43 p.m., a 44-year-old patrol officer with the Nogales Police Department (NPD) was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack while answering a call for service. Earlier in the day, a person called for a taxicab, intending to rob the driver and carjack the vehicle using a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. Once he was seated in the taxicab, the suspect assembled the weapon in the back seat, then informed the driver he was being robbed. When the driver did not cooperate, the suspect fired a round through the floor of the vehicle. Consequently, the taxicab lost power, and the driver ran from the vehicle. The suspect exited the taxicab and used his weapon to stop a passing truck. When he reached through the open driver-side window to open the door, the driver rolled up the window, temporarily trapping the suspect’s arm. The suspect freed his arm, and the driver sped away. Then the suspect stopped a car and ordered the couple inside to get out of the vehicle. Shortly after that, the suspect sent a friend a video via social media, informing her that he had stolen a car from two elderly people. At 2:24 p.m., the suspect pulled into the parking lot of a local business to find another vehicle. He walked to a trailer court behind the parking lot and stole another car from a man there and drove away. Meanwhile, the Arizona Department of Public Safety dispatch had alerted law enforcement about a suspect wielding a firearm. The NPD veteran officer, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, drove past the suspect, made a U-turn, activated his overhead emergency lights, and began following him. At 2:43 p.m., the suspect pulled into the parking lot of a market, exited the vehicle as it was still moving, and began firing at the officer’s patrol vehicle. The officer attempted to exit the vehicle, but the suspect used his body to slam the door and continued to fire through the window at the trapped officer. The officer was struck above his body armor in his neck/throat, front upper torso/chest, front lower torso/abdomen, arms, and hands. He subsequently died from his injuries. The suspect fled on foot and used his rifle to carjack another vehicle. He then drove to a house and attempted to kidnap the man who came to the door. However, the man told the suspect he had a child in the residence and could not leave, so the suspect stole the man’s vehicle instead. A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) agent passed the suspect, and after receiving an updated description of the suspect’s latest vehicle, turned around. The agent and two additional U.S. CBP units followed him to a trucking yard, where the suspect exited the vehicle, climbed over a fence, and hid under a mobile home. The 28-year-old suspect discharged the unspent cartridges, disassembled the weapon, and threw it out from underneath the residence. At approximately 3:28 p.m., he surrendered to officers and was taken into custody. He was charged with First-Degree Homicide, Aggravated Assault, Armed Robbery, Kidnapping, and Endangerment. He had a criminal history that included a drug law violation. A deputy marshal with the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) in Phoenix lost his life in a shootout with a suspect known for violent tendencies and mental illness.

During the confrontation, the suspect fired six rounds at the task force using a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle that he had built himself. Two of the rounds struck and killed the deputy marshal, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, mortally wounding him above his body armor in his front upper torso/chest.

"Two police agents with the Lakewood Police Department (Lakewood PD) survived injuries sustained on July 5 during a premeditated ambush. Around 9:40 p.m., Lakewood PD dispatch received two 911 calls from a female who reported she was in the process of separating from her husband, who was making suicidal comments. The caller stated her husband possessed several firearms, and he told her if she called the police, there would “be a battle.” She also reported that her husband sent a text message to her son threatening to kill him. Shortly before 10 p.m., a male caller contacted 911, identified himself by first name, and provided the same address as the female caller. The caller advised there was a “guy out front with a gun ready to kill a bunch of people.” When dispatch asked the man for his exact location, he said, “I’m the guy with the gun.” The caller told dispatchers that he had three guns, and he was outside his home in the back of his pickup truck. Police agents were dispatched to the scene; the first to arrive approached the residence from the west. The 32-year-old veteran agent, who had more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, turned off his patrol vehicle’s headlights and prepared to stop approximately four houses west of the man’s residence. However, before his vehicle came to a stop, the suspect fired his 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle and struck the agent, who was wearing body armor, in the front upper torso/chest and the arms/hands. The agent exited his patrol vehicle while it was still moving. The vehicle continued traveling east, unmanned, until it struck a truck in the suspect’s driveway and came to rest in the suspect’s front lawn. The agent radioed for assistance and applied a tourniquet to his wounded arm. Other agents arrived and assisted in moving the injured agent to a safer location west of the scene. From there, he was transported to a local hospital. Shortly after the first agent was shot, a second agent parked her patrol vehicle east of the suspect’s residence and attempted to approach on foot. The suspect fired another round from the same weapon and struck the 28-year-old agent, who was wearing body armor, in the front below the waist (leg). The agent, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, collapsed onto the sidewalk. Other agents arrived and assisted her to a safer location. She was also transported to a local hospital. After shooting the agents, the suspect exited his truck and walked out into the street. He called 911 again, apologized to dispatch, and said, “I hit that cop, and now it’s too far.” The suspect explained to dispatch that he was walking in the middle of the road, and he “has to die now.” Dispatch advised the suspect to speak to the agents. The suspect responded, “I just shot one. They’re going to have to kill me.” The suspect ended the call by providing his exact location, informing dispatch that he was far away from the scene, and instructing the dispatcher to get help for the wounded agents. Another agent heard about the incident on the radio and responded to the scene. He parked his patrol vehicle nearby and took cover behind a fire truck. When the fire truck moved, the agent saw the suspect walking in the middle of the street and carrying a .44- caliber revolver. The agent ordered the suspect to drop his weapon multiple times, but the suspect did not comply. Instead, the suspect raised his revolver and pointed it at the agent. The agent fired several rounds with his service weapon, striking the suspect once in the chest. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to a local hospital. The 54-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record with a conviction, was charged with two counts each of Attempted First-Degree Murder and First- Degree Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer as well as Felony Menacing. In an interview the next day, the suspect explained that he wanted to die but was concerned his wife would not receive the life insurance payout if his death were ruled a suicide. For that reason, he wanted to provoke the police into shooting him. The wounded veteran agent has since recovered from his injuries and returned to his duties. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the other wounded agent had not returned to duty.",1050
"On December 8, a 39-year-old officer with the Virginia Tech Police Department was killed in an unprovoked attack.

He returned to his police vehicle and sat inside using a mobile device to issue a ticket to the driver. About 12:15 p.m., a man approached the officer’s car and fired a single shot from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun through the open driver’s side window. The round struck the officer below his ear and caused a fatal injury to the back of his head. Witnesses reported the suspect was not associated with the traffic stop that had occurred minutes earlier. The shooter was observed using a firearm with his left hand, and was wearing a coat and hat. Additional officers immediately responded to the scene, searching for the suspect based upon the description of the clothes he was wearing. A deputy from the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office was driving through a parking lot on campus when he saw a man walking, but the man was not wearing the coat and hat matching the shooter’s description. The deputy turned his vehicle around in order to stop and question the man. When the deputy located him, he was lying in the parking lot with a single gunshot wound to his forehead. In his left hand, the injured man was holding the same gun used to shoot the officer. The deputy kicked the weapon away and secured the suspect with handcuffs. The 22-year-old shooter died at the scene from the self-inflicted gunshot wound. A backpack was later found behind some greenhouses near the lot where the officer was killed. The backpack contained the coat and hat described by witnesses, along with other items that were directly linked to the shooter.",826

The 49-year-old officer, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a vehicle and prepared to contact the vehicle’s driver. The vehicle drove away from the initial scene, and the officer followed. The vehicle stopped a second time, and the officer contacted the driver and the passenger. The passenger provided a false name and, during the subsequent interaction, fired four shots from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Two of the rounds struck the officer—once in the rear legs and once fatally in the rear upper torso/back above his body armor. The passenger also inadvertently shot the driver of the vehicle in the foot. The driver exited the vehicle; the suspect entered the driver’s side of the vehicle and fled the scene, leaving the injured former driver behind. Witnesses rendered medical aid to the victim officer and called for assistance using the officer’s portable radio. Additional officers arrived on the scene shortly afterward. Paramedics arrived and transported the victim officer to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

"A deputy sheriff with the Otero County Sheriff’s Department was killed on December 18 after responding to a call of shots fired in a suspected domestic incident. The 49-year-old deputy, who had 6 years of law enforcement experience, approached a home in the city of Cloudcroft with his partner at 6:30 p.m. while canvassing the neighborhood where the call originated in an effort to find the source of the shots. A man was on the front porch of the home, and a car was backed up to the door with its trunk open. The two officers made contact with the man, who went inside the home, slamming and locking the front door. The officers saw what they perceived to be blood on the front porch and backed away from the home, calling for backup. When the deputy went around the home to the rear porch, the man apparently ambushed him. He shot the deputy in the side of the head with a .357-caliber revolver and killed him. The shooter then went to the front of the house and fired at the other officer. The assisting officer returned fire, striking and killing the man.

"On October 27 at 11:40 p.m., a corporal and a patrol officer with the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department (SCMPD) were shot and wounded during a traffic stop. The 43-year-old veteran corporal, who had more than 7 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner stopped a vehicle after it failed to yield at an intersection and pulled out in front of their patrol vehicle, nearly causing a collision. The corporal approached the driver’s side of the vehicle, while his partner approached the passenger’s side. The corporal asked the driver for his driver’s license. The driver stated that he did not have his license with him, so the corporal ordered the driver to turn off the vehicle and hand over the keys. The corporal explained that he would place the keys on the vehicle’s roof just long enough to obtain and verify the driver’s information. The driver hesitated to hand over the keys, so the officer quickly took them. The driver continued to exhibit anxious behavior while the corporal was writing down his information, so the corporal asked him to exit the vehicle in order to check him for weapons. About this time, a second patrol vehicle arrived to provide backup. A 27-year-old SCMPD patrol officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner got out of the patrol vehicle. The patrol officer approached the driver’s side of the vehicle and stood behind the corporal as his partner walked toward the passenger’s side. The corporal opened the driver’s side door to allow the driver to exit the vehicle as he had requested. The driver did not comply and started inching toward the vehicle’s center console. When the corporal noticed the driver reaching into the console, he repeatedly commanded the driver to put his hands where the corporal could see them. The driver did not comply and continued reaching into the console, so the corporal leaned into the vehicle’s open door. With his left hand, the corporal grabbed the driver’s left arm while drawing his service weapon with his right hand. The driver suddenly exited the vehicle and fired a .38-caliber revolver in the direction of the corporal and the patrol officer, who were both wearing body armor.

When dispatch received the call for service, the deputy who was working the shift was about 20 miles from the scene. The deputy requested that the dispatcher ask an off-duty deputy to respond to the call in the town of Harlem. The responding deputy, who had 6 years of law enforcement service, went to the residence and approached the subject of the disturbance call, who left the premises on foot and ran across a nearby highway. The officer followed the man and had several encounters with him but was unable to handcuff him. At that point, the regular on-duty officer arrived to assist. First, he sprayed the suspect with pepper spray in an effort to subdue him. When this proved ineffective, he struck the man several times with an asp and forced him to the ground. Both deputies then seized him, but the man was able to grab the initial responding deputy’s service weapon. He fired two rounds, hitting both deputies.

"On April 20, a police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) was wounded during a foot pursuit with a subject. At 9:21 p.m., a 31-year-old officer with nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience and another LAPD officer were surveilling an area in a patrol vehicle, performing gang enforcement detail when they began following a vehicle for vehicle code violations. The officers turned on their emergency lights so the driver would pull the vehicle over to the side of the road. As the vehicle came to a stop near an intersection, the driver jumped out and ran into a nearby housing development. The officers believed the subject was armed with a handgun, so they exited their patrol vehicle and began pursuing him on foot.

At 10:40 p.m., witnesses began calling 911 to report gunfire coming from an individual in a sport utility vehicle (SUV) as it pulled out of a parking lot. Additional reports indicated the gunfire from the SUV struck a 17-year-old male driving a minivan, resulting in the minivan leaving the roadway and hitting a tree in the median.

About this time, the 34-year-old veteran officer, who had more than 5½ years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene and parked his patrol unit slightly south of the residence. The 28-year- old off-duty officer, who lived nearby, heard the gunshots and also went to investigate. He drove to the scene and observed the SUV parked haphazardly in the front yard. He parked his personal vehicle next to the on-duty officer’s patrol unit. The officers, both of whom were wearing body armor, conferred near their vehicles. When the individual came to the door of the residence, the 34-year-old officer used the spotlight from his patrol unit to illuminate the scene. The individual briefly retreated into the residence and then reappeared on the porch, firing at the officers with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. The gunfire struck the 34-year-old officer in the front upper torso/chest, piercing his body armor.

"A deputy sheriff from the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department (PCSD) was killed on January 7 when he answered a call for service regarding a home invasion robbery in Frederickson. At 11:24 p.m., the PCSD dispatcher received a call reporting an intruder in the caller’s mobile home. The dispatcher could hear sounds of screaming and a struggle. In subsequent interviews, PCSD detectives determined that at the time of the invasion, there were three males, one female, and two small children living in the mobile home. All of the residents except for one male roommate were inside when the invasion occurred. The three adult victims reported that they heard a knock at the back door, then the doorknob being jiggled, and a kitchen window breaking. A victim reported seeing the first suspect, masked and carrying a handgun, climb through the broken window, then unlock and open the door for the second suspect, who was also masked and armed with a handgun and a long knife. One of the victims grabbed a baseball bat and struck the first suspect in the head, while another victim called 911. The first suspect struggled with the victim as the second suspect searched the house for cash and narcotics. At 11:29 p.m., the 34- year-old deputy arrived at the scene. The deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with 9 years of experience, pulled up behind two newly arrived vehicles at the residence. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, spoke with the occupants of the vehicles, who indicated one of them lived at the mobile home and the other was a friend. Meanwhile, the victims and the suspects saw the fourth roommate’s vehicle and the deputy’s patrol vehicle pull into the driveway. The suspects panicked and ran from the home as two of the victims jumped out of the windows. The deputy ordered the suspects to get on the ground, but they did not comply. At 11:33 p.m., the deputy notified dispatch that he was in pursuit of two suspects who were running through the yard toward the street. Twenty seconds later, the deputy reported shots fired. When the dispatcher replied to the deputy, there was no response. The dispatcher remotely opened the deputy’s portable radio microphone to listen for communication. At 11:37 p.m., backup deputies arrived on the scene and found the victim deputy along a path. He had been fatally shot once in the neck/throat. Deputies and medical personnel attempted life-saving measures, but the Pierce County Medical Examiner determined the victim deputy had died instantly. Deputies also located the body of a 35-year-old suspect. The suspect was wearing a ballistic vest that had been struck by four .40-caliber rounds in the torso area. The rounds were consistent with the fallen deputy’s service weapon, a semiautomatic handgun. Deputies searched the area and found a safe and a backpack that had been stolen from the residence as well as the suspect’s .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Further investigation determined that the suspect had fired three rounds at the victim deputy at close range; only one round struck the deputy. The suspect was known to the PCSD for previous criminal contacts and possessing a controlled substance. His criminal history included previous incarceration and a previous violent crime. Officers locked down the area in an attempt to find the second suspect.

A PCSD sergeant spoke with the person, who was wet, shivering, dirty, and appeared to be suffering from the onset of hypothermia. His pants were ripped, and he had large cuts on his hands. The suspect had a bear-spray holster and a pocketknife but was otherwise unarmed. He told officers his name and said he was walking in the area to visit his girlfriend and provided a false name. Officers determined the provided name was false and the suspect had three active warrants. He was transported to the Pierce County Jail. Detectives linked the suspect directly to the homicide using evidence such as text messages between the suspect and his girlfriend regarding the incident and video of the suspect hiding in a nearby industrial area and in a garbage can.
