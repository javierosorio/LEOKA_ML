"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence. After a standoff of several hours, SWAT officers arrested the alleged shooter without further incident. He was charged with Murder.",196
"On August 12 around 3:40 p.m., a 33-year-old patrol officer with the Hatch Police Department was fatally wounded while making a traffic stop. The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects. The 38-year-old man who allegedly shot the victim officer was charged with Murder, Possession of a Firearm, Firing Weapon, and Carjacking.

The victim officer was airlifted to a nearby hospital where he died later that day.",798
"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

He had a previous criminal record that included drug violations, violent crime, and weapons violations.",1124
"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder.

"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31.

"An officer with the Buckeye Police Department (BPD) was shot and killed, and another BPD officer was shot and wounded after conducting a traffic stop at 1 a.m. on May 1 in Phoenix. While completing an off-duty security shift at an outdoor facility, a 34-year-old officer, who had over 5 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a vehicle for reckless driving in the parking lot. The vehicle was occupied by three males. Another officer, a 37-year-old who had over 11 years of law enforcement experience, arrived to assist with the traffic stop and with language translation. After removing the occupants and determining that the vehicle would be towed, the veteran officers permitted the occupants to recover personal items from the vehicle. As the officers stood at the driver’s side observing the occupants’ activity through the tinted windows, one of the passengers circled behind them from the rear passenger side to the rear driver’s side. He then shot the 37-year-old officer in his lower back below his body armor and fatally in the back of his head with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun.

"Two veteran police officers with the Mamaroneck Police Department (MPD) were stabbed and injured while answering a call for service on the afternoon of April 28. At 1:29 p.m., an MPD dispatcher received a 911 call from a frantic woman reporting someone was dying at a residence. The dispatcher sent all MPD units and an ambulance to the residence. Multiple officers responded around the same time and encountered a woman who was crying hysterically and saying “my daughter, my grandbaby” repeatedly. She led officers to a side door and gave them the keys to unlock it, as her hands were shaking too badly to do it herself. A group of four officers entered the kitchen, and one of them announced “police” loudly multiple times. In an attempt to clear the house, the officers split up. A 33-year-old police officer, who had 9 years of law enforcement experience, went downstairs with his weapon drawn to secure the basement, where he observed blood spots on the wet floor and a bathtub filled with bloody water in a bathroom. At the same time upstairs, officers walked down a hallway where they saw two closed doors and a number of handwritten notes stuck to the walls with unclear phrases written on them. They opened the first door and found a small, unresponsive child covered by a small blanket or towel and lying on a bed. Her cover included a note that appeared to ask God to accept “my baby.” The 53-year-old officer, who had 17 years of law enforcement experience, immediately started performing CPR on the child and radioed for EMS assistance; the other two officers continued clearing the house. The officers opened the second closed door and encountered a woman standing in the darkened bedroom holding both hands behind her back. She had a bleeding cut on her neck and was staring blankly at the officers. They repeatedly ordered the woman to show her hands, but she did not comply or speak. Additional officers arrived at the scene. Another officer switched places with the 53-year-old officer, and took over performing CPR on the child. The 53-year-old officer then entered the second bedroom with his weapon drawn and ordered the woman to show her hands and get on the floor. The officer had a light mounted on his firearm, which helped him clearly see the woman. As the 53-year-old officer started to switch his firearm for an electronic control device, the woman raised her hands above her head, clutching a large knife in each hand, and ran toward the officers. By this time, the 33-year-old officer had cleared the downstairs and joined the other officers. He and another officer deployed their electronic control devices, striking the suspect in her middle back and side. However, the shock had no effect on the woman. The suspect charged the officers, wildly swinging both knives. The officers backed away and used their arms to deflect the knives, then tripped and fell to the ground. The offender continued to slash at the officers, while they tried to kick the knives away from her. A third officer fired three rounds at the suspect, striking her twice and stopping her attack. The 53-year-old officer suffered a laceration to his left hand, and the 33-year-old officer was stabbed in the foot. Emergency services personnel arrived and began treating the injured offender while the 53-year-old officer returned to the child, who had no pulse, and began chest compressions again. Other officers began clearing the house. Another officer took over CPR on the child, while the 53-year-old officer returned to his patrol unit to retrieve his K-9 partner to help clear the building. On the second floor, the K-9 picked up the scent of a person behind a closed, locked door. An unarmed man exited the room with his hands up, and the officer handcuffed him. Officers later determined the man was a tenant and had nothing to do with the incident. Emergency personnel cleaned and bandaged both officers’ wounds and removed the deceased child to a waiting ambulance. Both officers went to a local hospital where they were treated and released.

"As they exited their vehicles, the male suspect, who was hiding near the stolen patrol unit, immediately opened fire from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. Because they did not yet realize the patrol unit in the driveway had been stolen by the male suspect, the detectives and the deputy were not certain from which direction the shots were coming. The detective from the lead car, a 15-year veteran of law enforcement, dropped to the ground and retreated to the rear of his vehicle as the male suspect fired on him. The veteran detective, who was wearing body armor, was struck in the rear upper torso/back where the round entered above his vest.

Two police officers responded in separate vehicles to a silent alarm at a local pawn store. They parked their vehicles in front of the store but out of sight of the store’s glass doors and windows. The officers went to the front glass doors and spotted the gunman at the counter. The gunman saw them and opened fire through the doors. Both officers retreated to their patrol cars for cover. As the 46-year-old officer, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, went to the trunk of his car to get his rifle, the suspect came to the glass doors, opened one of them, and began firing. The veteran officer was hit in the upper back; however, the bullet did not penetrate his body armor. Both officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who retreated into the shop. Moments later, most of the employees exited a side door. The suspect exited the same side door and jogged down an alley headed towards the rear of the building. At this time, the sergeant, a 27-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived in his marked patrol vehicle behind the suspect. The suspect turned and fired one round through the passenger side windshield of the sergeant’s vehicle. The sergeant struck the suspect with his vehicle; the suspect hit the hood and landed against the windshield, crushing it in. The sergeant stopped his vehicle and the suspect rolled off, knocking the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his hand. The suspect got up and ran, and the sergeant exited his vehicle and chased after him. As the suspect rounded a street corner, the sergeant deployed an electronic control device (ECD) and fired two darts at the suspect’s back. The ECD did not affect the suspect because he was wearing body armor. The suspect continued running, and according to a witness, he unzipped his jacket and pulled out a second weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The sergeant, who was also wearing a protective vest, drew his service weapon, and a gun battle ensued between the two men who were separated by less than 8 feet. As the sergeant attempted to reload his weapon, he was hit in the front of the head and died instantly. The suspect was hit in his chest, but his protective armor prevented any of the rounds from penetrating his body. He was also believed to have gunshot injuries to his groin area, but they did not incapacitate him. The suspect was walking away as the two officers who had first responded came upon the victim sergeant. The suspect shot at the officers, who returned fire, striking the back of his neck and his body armor. He dropped his weapon, tried to continue walking, but collapsed to the ground. The officers approached the suspect and handcuffed him. The 25-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with Felony Murder, First- Degree Murder, three counts of Attempted First-Degree Murder, and Aggravated Robbery. The officer injured in the first moments of the incident was transported to the hospital due to blunt trauma where the bullet impacted his body armor. He was later released and has since returned to duty. ",465
"Shortly after midnight on February 20, a 44-year-old agent with the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics (MBN), Greenwood District, was shot and killed during a tactical situation. The agent, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 22 years of experience, responded to a residence where a man had threatened law enforcement and was barricaded inside. The agent was accompanied by the Mississippi Highway Patrol (MHP) SWAT team including a 39-year-old veteran trooper with more than 9 years of law enforcement experience, a 38-year-old veteran lieutenant with 16 years of law enforcement experience, and a 35-year-old veteran corporal with more than 7 years of law enforcement experience. Around 5 p.m. the previous day, a family member called 911 to report a domestic incident at the location. Law enforcement arrived and learned the man’s wife and young child were barricaded in the residence with him. Officers began negotiations with the man, but he refused to release his wife and child. Sometime after midnight, following several hours of negotiations, the SWAT team developed a plan to enter the residence. Two groups of SWAT members attempted to enter: one through the front door and one through the side door. The lieutenant’s team successfully entered the residence through the side door and was met with gunfire. The lieutenant was in the living room of the house when he was struck with a projectile and injured. The group, which included the MBN agent and the MHP SWAT team trooper and corporal, attempted to enter through the front door, but it was barricaded. The suspect used a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle to shoot at the officers as they stood on the front porch. The MBN veteran agent was fatally wounded in the front upper torso/chest by a round that entered above his body armor. He was pronounced deceased at the scene. The MHP SWAT team trooper, lieutenant, and corporal were each struck in the front of their bodies below the waist, but survived their injuries. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, none of the injured SWAT team members had returned to duty. The 45-year-old suspect, who was under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident, was justifiably killed by law enforcement. He was known to suffer from a mental illness and had a prior criminal record which included a violent crime.",990
"On January 22 at 8:50 a.m., a 28-year-old deputy sheriff and a 38-year-old sergeant with the Del Norte County Sheriff’s Office (DNCSO) were stabbed and injured while answering a disturbance call in Crescent City. A woman called dispatch and reported her roommate was in her room yelling at her. The deputy sheriff, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence and was met at the front door by the roommate, who let the deputy in. Once inside, the deputy turned on his body camera and then spoke with both roommates about the dispute. The man was primarily upset that the woman had turned off the internet service. The woman wanted the man to move out of the residence. After hearing both accounts, the deputy determined the matter was civil in nature and not criminal, but he tried to offer a resolution by suggesting the man leave the residence for a while. The deputy offered the man a ride, but the man did not want to leave without his cats. He tried to call a friend to come get him, but the friend did not answer the phone. The man told the deputy he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and repeatedly said that he would hurt his roommate if he remained there. Based on these recurring statements, the deputy determined the man should be placed in protective custody. The deputy asked if he would speak to mental health workers, and the man declined. During their interactions, the deputy saw what he thought was a rifle inside the residence and a sheathed knife on the man. Around 9:20 a.m., the deputy radioed for backup using a code indicating weapons were present. When the sergeant, an 11-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived at the residence at 9:29 a.m., the deputy had the man step outside. As the sergeant, who was also wearing a body camera, approached, the deputy reiterated the statements the man had told him so the sergeant could ascertain the seriousness of the situation. The deputy asked the man about the rifle and knife he observed in the residence; the man said it was a pellet gun and admitted he had a knife. The deputy told the man they were going to take him into custody for a mental health evaluation and began to move near him. The subject began yelling repeatedly that he did not want to deal with “mental health in this county.” The officers ordered him not to reach for anything and repeatedly told him to put his hands behind his head; however, he refused to comply. As the officers talked to the subject in an attempt to calm him, the subject said that someone was coming to pick him up and that he would leave his roommate alone. The subject then advised the officers he was going to reach for his phone. The sergeant warned the subject that reaching for anything would result in a firearm being pointed at him. The sergeant again implored the subject to place his hands on the back of his head. The subject then put his hand on his knife, so the deputy pointed his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun toward the man and notified dispatch “one at gunpoint.” The officers continued to command the subject to put his hands on his head, and at one point the subject replied, “No! You’re going to have to shoot.” Around 9:34 a.m., the sergeant moved toward the subject in an effort to subdue him; the subject pulled his knife from its sheath. The deputy called dispatch again for backup. The sergeant attempted to control the subject’s hands, but he maneuvered the knife and stabbed the sergeant on the top of both hands and wrists. The sergeant lost his grip, and the deputy then engaged in a physical confrontation with the subject, attempting to pull him down. As the officers tried to gain control of the subject, he turned and stabbed the sergeant in the left side of his back. The blade penetrated the sergeant’s uniform and partially penetrated his ballistic vest; the body armor prevented the blade from piercing the sergeant’s skin. The subject turned and attacked the deputy with the knife, resulting in a 6-inch cut on the left side of the deputy’s head. The subject fell to the ground but got back up and rushed several feet toward the deputy, who attempted to pull his weapon and stand up before the subject reached him. The subject tried to stab the deputy in his lower left chest; however, the deputy backed up and the subject cut the deputy’s shirt cuff. The subject again turned toward the sergeant, who had drawn his duty weapon and was attempting to get to his feet as the subject raised the knife above his head. The subject was almost on top of the sergeant when the sergeant fired his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded subject fell to the ground. The sergeant also fell to the ground. The deputy, who was approximately 10 feet from the subject, noticed the subject was trying to get up, so he fired three rounds from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, further incapacitating the subject. At 9:35 a.m., the sergeant told dispatchers that shots were fired, an officer was down, and medical attention was needed. The sergeant and deputy ordered the subject, who had risen to his hands and knees, to stay down, but he continued to disregard commands. The subject laid down, but continued roll around. The deputy readied his electronic control device and retrieved the knife from the ground near the subject’s feet. At about 9:38 a.m., law enforcement officers began arriving on scene. A police officer with the Crescent City Police Department placed the subject in handcuffs. Ambulance crews arrived and began treating the deputy and the subject, who were both taken to a local hospital by ambulance. The sergeant was taken to a local hospital by DNCSO deputies. The deputy received 10 staples in his head, and the sergeant received three stitches in his hand. They were released from the hospital and have returned to duty. The 38-year-old subject succumbed to his injuries later that day. The subject, who was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime.",854
"At 3:48 p.m. on December 9, a 46-year-old sergeant with the Atchison Police Department was shot and killed in an ambush. Earlier that day, the sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 24 years of experience, accompanied code enforcement officers to clean up a residence where an individual had been retrieving scrap metal without a license. As the officers and the cleanup crew were beginning to wrap up, a man, who was not involved in the cleanup effort, approached the sergeant and fired a single shot from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The sergeant was wearing body armor, but the round struck him fatally in the rear of the head. The 25-year-old suspect then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. The suspect, who was on parole at the time of the incident, was known to have prior mental disorders and a criminal history that included violent crime and police assault.",1149

During the struggle, the man disarmed the officer and fled the scene with the officer’s service weapon. The suspect remains at large.",799
"A 41-year-old criminal intelligence (CI) officer with the Fort Worth Police Department (FWPD) lost his life shortly after midnight on September 14 while investigating a series of armed robberies occurring at bars and cantinas in the area. Days earlier, robbery detectives identified two possible suspect vehicles—a truck and an SUV—from surveillance video related to two of the robberies. The FWPD CI Unit identified the possible driver of the SUV. On September 9, a robbery detective requested a Special Response Team to locate the vehicle. Officers observed the SUV meet up with a truck matching the description of the second vehicle. The robbery detectives did not have enough information to issue arrest warrants, so they conducted surveillance on the two vehicles. ",35
"Around 10:40 p.m. on July 8, a 36-year-old officer with the Beaumont Police Department was killed while attempting to stop a vehicle involved in a high-speed chase. The suspect had fled from the scene of a domestic dispute in a vehicle, leading officers on a chase that reached speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour. In addition to the driver’s disregard for numerous traffic laws, the vehicle was observed traveling with the headlights turned off, posing a great threat to public safety. In an effort to stop the suspect, the veteran officer, with 10½ years of law enforcement experience, had parked in a turning lane on the suspect’s expected route and had exited his vehicle to deploy a tire-deflation device. Witnesses reported that as the suspect’s vehicle approached the officer’s parked patrol vehicle, beside which the officer was standing, the suspect steered his car into the patrol vehicle. The violent impact of the vehicles caused fatal injuries to the victim officer. The 30-year-old suspect was transported to the hospital where he was expected to recover from injuries he suffered in the collision. He was arrested and charged with Capital Murder.",1134
"Around 3:15 p.m. on May 12, police officers with the Greenville Police Department were dispatched to a residence on a domestic disturbance call. During the incident, a 50-year-old veteran officer with 29 years of law enforcement experience was injured with a knife. Two officers initially responded to the scene of the domestic disturbance and found a man in the yard of the residence. He explained he had called the police because his roommate was “off his medication” and had punched him. Dispatchers had warned the officers that the suspect may be armed with a knife, and the roommate confirmed he was. The officers began walking toward the residence as the suspect came around the west side of the house. One of the officers knew the suspect, and it was clear the suspect disliked that officer. Because of the suspect’s hostility, the other officer took over interviewing the suspect about the situation. The suspect admitted that he punched his roommate in the head saying it was “because he wouldn’t give me a cigarette.” The officer told the suspect she needed to search him for weapons, and the suspect reluctantly agreed. The suspect was unarmed, and the officer began to pull his arms around to handcuff him. The suspect spun around, took an aggressive stance, and backed away from the officers. One officer pulled out his electronic control device (ECD), and the other officer told the suspect to stop or her partner would use the ECD. The suspect indicated he didn’t care if they did and continued backing away. The first officer told her partner to discharge the ECD, but the suspect turned and fled. The officers called for backup as they chased the suspect, who forcefully threw a large piece of wood with a steel latch at them. The object missed the officers, and the suspect retreated into the house. The officers secured both the front and rear of the residence as other officers arrived to assist. One of the initial officers on the scene spoke with a K-9 officer and told him the suspect was not concerned about the threat of an ECD, but he might respond to a K-9. By this time, several officers were on the front porch. One tried the front door and found it to be unlocked. They called to the suspect to come out. When he did not respond, one officer opened the door and found the suspect standing at the foot of a nearby staircase holding a knife. Officers instructed the man to drop the knife or they would use an ECD on him. (The K-9 was also ready to be deployed.) The suspect then threw the knife at the officers. The handle grazed the head of one officer and struck a 50-year-old veteran officer (who was wearing body armor) in the front of the head, causing a large gash on his chin and profuse bleeding. Officers deployed three ECD cartridges on the suspect with minimal effect, but he surrendered after the K-9 subdued him. The suspect, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, continued to struggle after he was handcuffed and taken to the front yard to receive medical assistance. The suspect was subsequently transported to the hospital to have the K-9 bite treated. The victim officer, who was in shock, was also taken to the hospital where he received 11 stitches for the cut on his chin. The 26-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record including a violent crime and drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. The suspect was charged with Assault Causing Bodily Injury—Family Violence; two counts of Aggravated Assault on a Peace Officer; and Resisting Arrest, Search, or Transport, with a Deadly Weapon. The injured officer has since returned to duty.",1139
"On August 28, two officers with the Hoonah Police Department were targeted in an ambush shortly before 11 p.m. The first officer, a 31-year-old sergeant with more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, was on duty. The second officer, a 39-year-old police officer with 1½ years of law enforcement experience, was off duty when he stopped to talk to the on-duty sergeant. As the men spoke, the sergeant was shot in the back with an unknown caliber rifle. The force of the round penetrated the sergeant’s protective vest, wounding him. The off-duty officer radioed for backup and began to drag the sergeant to cover when the suspect fired four more rounds, striking the sergeant in the front below his waist and the off-duty officer twice in the chest. Backup officers arrived and moved both victims to cover until emergency medical personnel could get there. The victim officer was moved to the local clinic where he died 45 minutes later.

"At approximately noon on a warm winter day in the West, a uniformed officer, who had 31 years of law enforcement experience, was sitting in a booth at a restaurant eating lunch with two plain-clothed officers. A man entered the restaurant and made his way over to the officers. As the man approached the officers, he removed a machete from behind his back and raised it to strike the uniformed officer in the head. One of the plain-clothed officers alerted the uniformed officer of the man's actions just in time for the uniformed officer to raise his hand to defend himself.

"A 23-year-old trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), Huntingdon Station, was shot and killed while conducting investigative activity around 6:20 p.m. on December 30. In response to a woman’s complaint that her ex-boyfriend had violated a Protection From Abuse (PFA) court order, the trooper, who had 1 year of law enforcement experience, went to the man’s residence to question him. According to the complaint, the man had allegedly left several gifts inside the woman’s vehicle at her place of employment, which violated the no-contact clause of the PFA order. The trooper, who was wearing body armor, entered the residence, began questioning the man, and then asked him to step outside onto the porch to discuss the matter further. According to the subject’s mother, who was in the residence at the time, the man asked the trooper if he could get a cigarette from his bedroom before they went outside. The man went to his bedroom, and the trooper met him in the hallway as he came out. They proceeded to exit the residence, first the trooper and then the man, with the man’s mother following behind. As they exited, the man’s mother saw her son pull a weapon from his waistband area, and she yelled at him. The trooper turned, and the subject shot the trooper in the head with a .32- caliber semiautomatic handgun. The victim trooper was fatally wounded in both the front and rear of his head. The subject’s mother then fled the scene with her boyfriend, who had been in the basement and reported the shooting. The subject later fled the scene on foot before authorities could apprehend him. Around 9:45 a.m. the next day, as members of the PSP Special Emergency Response Team were clearing the crime scene, members of the PSP Troop G worked to clear nearby structures and found the subject hiding in an unoccupied camper approximately ¼ mile from the scene. Upon making verbal contact with the suspect, troopers could not get him to comply with their commands. When the suspect made a move to come out of the camper toward the troopers with a firearm in his right hand, he was justifiably killed. The 32-year-old offender, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record which included a violent crime.",213

According to the woman driving the vehicle, the officer approached the passenger side of the automobile to speak to the individual who was riding with her in the front seat. The officer, who was a member of the Merced Police Department’s Gang Unit and had nearly 8 years of experience, apparently recognized the man in the vehicle as a convicted drug dealer who was on parole. He began to search the subject, whereupon the man pushed the officer away and ran off. The officer gave chase and was fatally wounded when the suspect turned and fired three rounds from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun at his pursuer.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Batesville Police Department was critically injured on November 3 while investigating a domestic violence incident. Shortly after 7 p.m., a woman arrived at the county sheriff’s office to report that her intoxicated husband had struck her during an argument about 30 minutes prior in Batesville. An officer from the Batesville PD came to assist and asked the woman if she would like to go to a women’s shelter for her safety; the woman answered yes. On the way to the shelter, the woman decided to file charges against her husband. The officer contacted Batesville’s police chief to discuss the situation and then contacted the 31-year-old patrol officer and asked him to go to the couple’s residence to arrest the husband for domestic battery. The police chief planned to meet the patrol officer there. Just before 8 p.m., the patrol officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence.

They planned to meet a third detective, from the Crime Scene Unit (CSU), at the residence. Upon arrival, the detectives parked their unmarked police vehicle opposite the victim’s residence. Several hours earlier, the suspect had attacked the victim, destroyed some of her belongings, and fatally stabbed her dog. He also called the victim after the initial incident and threatened her. When the third detective reached the scene, the detectives and the victim approached the front of the residence where the victim pointed out evidence in some trash cans. The detectives stopped to examine the evidence when the suspect emerged from within the residence. The victim identified the suspect and said, “He is right there. Arrest him.” Before the detectives could react, the suspect opened fire with a .38-caliber revolver. The HU and SVU detectives were struck. The HU detective was hit in the front lower torso/abdomen and rear lower torso/back and the SVU detective was hit in the front lower torso/abdomen and in his arms/hands. The SVU detective was knocked to the ground; while on the street, he observed that the suspect had exited the porch of the residence and was headed directly toward him, continuing to fire.

"Around 6:30 a.m. on May 30, a 32-year-old sergeant with the Dickson County Sheriff’s Office (DCSO) was shot and killed while answering a call for service in Dickson. The sergeant responded to a call for a welfare check on a vehicle parked on the wrong side of the road with two occupants inside who appeared to be sleeping or passed out. The veteran sergeant, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, parked his marked patrol vehicle in front and to the side of the parked vehicle. He was wearing a body camera that recorded the incident. A female exited the passenger’s side of the vehicle; the sergeant told her to return to the car. The sergeant approached the driver’s side of the vehicle and asked the occupants for identification. Instead, the male suspect provided a Social Security number that was later found to be false. The sergeant radioed his location to a DCSO deputy then walked to the back of the vehicle and radioed the vehicle’s tag number to dispatchers. The sergeant learned the vehicle had been reported as stolen, so he returned to the driver’s side door and ordered the suspect to exit the vehicle. The suspect claimed the driver’s side door wouldn’t open, so the sergeant ordered the suspect to exit through the passenger’s side door while keeping his hands visible. As the sergeant began to walk around the back of the vehicle toward the passenger’s side, the suspect fired multiple rounds from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, striking the sergeant. The sergeant ran toward the back of the vehicle to find cover and attempted to radio that shots had been fired; however, after running a short distance, the sergeant collapsed. The suspect exited the vehicle, walked over to the sergeant, stood over him, and shot him several more times. The sergeant received a total of six gunshot wounds to the side of the head, the front upper torso/chest, and the arms/hands. The suspect loaded the deceased sergeant into the back seat of the patrol vehicle. The suspect, posing as the sergeant, radioed dispatchers and reported everything was fine, and a suspect was in custody. Then he drove the patrol vehicle away from the scene. A DCSO deputy used the GPS in the sergeant’s patrol vehicle to locate the vehicle in a field. Other units responded to the field and discovered the patrol vehicle was locked and filled with smoke; the suspect had started a fire inside before fleeing. Deputies broke the patrol vehicle’s window and found the victim sergeant’s body inside. The suspect had stolen the sergeant’s service weapon (a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun), backup weapon (a .357-caliber semiautomatic handgun), and pocket knife.

"On February 6 at 9:19 a.m., a 35-year-old police officer with the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) was killed while attempting to serve a search warrant. The officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 14 years’ experience, was working as a member of MPD’s Tactical Engagement Unit to serve a no-knock warrant on a suspect believed to be illegally purchasing and selling firearms and marijuana. The tactical team, who were all wearing body armor, ballistic helmets, and body cameras, approached the back of the suspect’s residence from a nearby alley. One officer covered two other officers while they used a ram to break down the back door. After the first door strike, an officer announced, “Police! Search warrant!” and a second door-strike opened the back door to the multiple-occupancy building. Throughout the encounter, officers continued to loudly declare, “Police! Search warrant!” Three officers began climbing the back stairs to the upper unit where the suspect lived. The door to the unit was locked, so the 35-year-old officer used a one-person ram tool to create a large opening in the door. Almost immediately, the suspect fired four rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic handgun through the opening. One round entered the victim officer’s protective vest through the armhole/ shoulder area and struck his shoulder (upper torso) area. An assisting officer stepped toward the opening, aimed his rifle into the residence, and observed the suspect with his hands in the air. Officers took the suspect into custody, while other officers carried the victim officer out of the building and into the back yard.

The plainclothes officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 10 years’ experience, was driving an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows and was accompanied by another officer.

A man who had been sitting in the rear passenger side of the vehicle exited the car and started to flee on foot; however, he suddenly returned to the vehicle, grabbed one of the three passengers as a hostage, and attempted to use the individual as a shield. As the man attempted to leave the scene, the hostage broke free, ran in the direction of the police vehicle, and jumped over a guard rail into a ditch. The suspect fired a .38-caliber revolver in the direction of the officer, who had exited the police car and had positioned himself at the right rear of the car for cover. During the ensuing exchange of gunfire, the suspect grabbed a second person from inside the vehicle and attempted to steal the officer’s police vehicle. The officer fired eight rounds at the suspect, six of which struck the assailant, though none were fatal. One of the shots from the assailant’s gun struck the victim officer in the right side between the panels of his protective vest, and he collapsed to the ground. As the suspect forced the hostage into the driver’s side of the police car, another officer arrived on the scene and more shooting broke out. The responding officer fired a fatal shot into the neck of the suspect, who died at the scene. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital, where he died a short time later. Subsequent investigation of the incident revealed that the robbery suspect had taken the three hostages from inside the bank, along with a fourth whom he had forced to attend to the bank’s drive-through facility in order to avoid suspicion. Although the suspect’s vehicle was located a short distance from the bank, the suspect ordered one of the three hostages to drive her vehicle when they left the bank. The 43-year-old alleged assailant, a known drug dealer, had a prior criminal record that involved various violent crimes, including drug abuse and weapons violations.",426
"Around 11:45 a.m. on February 19, a 48-year-old police officer with the Bay City Department of Public Safety (BCDPS) was shot and wounded while assisting in a tactical situation. Earlier that morning, a BCDPS task force learned a subject had violated his conditional release bond the previous day. Around 10 a.m., three BCDPS officers in unmarked vehicles began physical surveillance of the suspect’s residence. At approximately 10:30 a.m., the suspect came outside the residence to greet a male visitor. The man and the suspect both entered the residence. Slightly more than an hour later, the officers saw the man and the suspect leave the residence. Both men got into their vehicles, the man drove away first, and seconds later the suspect followed. Both vehicles turned onto another street, where a uniformed BCDPS officer in a fully marked patrol unit was positioned to enact a traffic stop on the suspect. One of the plainclothes officers joined the uniformed officer at the side of the road, where the uniformed officer ordered the suspect to exit his vehicle. However, the suspect disregarded the order and sped away. The two officers ran back to the marked patrol unit, and a vehicle chase ensued. The officer in the passenger’s seat notified dispatch of the pursuit, as the suspect led the officers back to his residence. The suspect parked his vehicle in his driveway, jumped out, and ran toward a basement window on the north side of the house. The plainclothes officer exited the patrol unit and continued the chase on foot. When the suspect reached the basement window, he broke the glass and attempted to dive inside. However, he got stuck halfway through the opening with his right arm and right leg still outside the window. The officer grabbed the suspect’s arm and attempted to pull him back outside. During the struggle, the uniformed officer arrived to assist. When the suspect’s arm slipped from the plainclothes officer’s grasp, the suspect fell into the basement, and the officer stumbled backward. The uniformed officer covered the window and ordered the suspect to come out. The plainclothes officer then ran back to the patrol unit, which was parked in the driveway, to turn off the vehicle’s siren. As he was running, he heard a single gunshot coming from the basement. After turning off the siren and starting back toward the basement window, the officer heard several more gunshots coming from the west side of the residence. He took cover at the corner of the street and saw that the uniformed officer had taken cover behind the front wheel located on the driver’s side of the patrol unit. He then noticed another one of the plainclothes officers had arrived to assist and had been struck in the rear lower torso/back with a round from the suspect’s 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded police officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 22 years of experience, had taken cover behind the rear wheel located on the driver’s side of his unmarked vehicle. Both the uniformed officer and the wounded plainclothes officer were trapped behind their vehicles with no escape routes from the suspect who had barricaded himself inside the residence. At that time, four additional BCDPS officers arrived on the scene. The initial plainclothes officer obtained a department-issued AR-15 rifle from the arriving officers and positioned himself to cover the officers who were still unable to move from their locations. Officers from other local agencies and the Michigan State Police Emergency Support Team also responded to assist. The suspect committed suicide several hours later. The 38-year-old man, who was known by law enforcement to deal drugs, had a prior criminal record including charges for a police assault, weapons violation, and drug law violation. The victim officer was treated at a nearby hospital for his injury and has since returned to duty.",1136
"One police officer with the Newtown Township Police Department was fatally shot and another was assaulted while handling a prisoner around 6:20 p.m., on September 29. A man in custody for possibly driving under the influence had been transported to a medical facility where he was to provide blood and urine samples as the two officers and a medical technician monitored him. After exiting the bathroom, the suspect was directed to turn around so that one of the officers could handcuff him. As the 31-year-old officer, who had nearly 5 years’ law enforcement experience, reached for his handcuffs from under his jacket, the suspect suddenly turned and disarmed him. The officer reached toward the suspect; however, the suspect blocked the officer with his hand and fired one shot from the officer’s .357-caliber revolver. The round went through the suspect’s own hand and struck the officer in the chest, knocking him to the floor. The suspect then shot the 46-year-old officer, who had over 2 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor, in the abdominal area, knocking him to the floor as well. The gunman then shot the medical technician, walked over to the second victim officer, and fatally shot the officer in the left temple. Reportedly, he stood over the officer, made a derogatory remark, leaned down, and fired another bullet into the lower left side of the officer’s head. The gunman walked back over to the first victim officer, who was still lying on the floor. He aimed the gun at the officer’s head and pulled the trigger five times. However, the gun was out of ammunition. Next, the man ran down a corridor toward the emergency room waiting area, where he dropped the victim officer’s gun on the floor before exiting to an attached parking garage. Officials placed the medical center in a lockdown status, and police SWAT teams searched the facility. A SWAT officer discovered the gunman sitting in a vehicle that he had apparently broken into on the top level of the parking garage. When the man refused to get out of the vehicle, officers deployed a flash-bang and broke out one of the vehicle’s windows to gain access to the man. After a brief struggle, officers arrested the 38-year-old man, who was under the influence of alcohol and had an extensive criminal record including police assault. Charges against the offender include First-Degree Murder, Aggravated Assault (4 counts), Robbery (4 counts), Terroristic Threats (2 counts), Recklessly Endangering Another (10 counts), Escape, Former Criminal Not to Own a Firearm, Criminal Attempt at Murder (2 Counts), Simple Assault, Unlawful Restraint, DUI, Resisting Arrest, and Disarming a Law Enforcement Officer.

"Just after 8 p.m. on June 19, a 31-year-old police officer with the Port Orchard Police Department (Port Orchard PD) was assaulted and injured while attempting an arrest. The officer, along with two other Port Orchard PD officers, were attempting to locate a suspect who had a felony warrant from another state for Child Molestation and misdemeanor warrants for Assault, Assault-Domestic Violence, and Malicious Mischief-Domestic Violence. The officers located the suspect inside a bar. Two of the officers entered the bar, one of whom was the 31-year-old officer who had 1½ years of law enforcement experience. The third officer stationed himself in an alley near the bar’s back door. The suspect, who worked as a disc jockey in the bar, requested that he be permitted to shut down the music system. As the man moved toward the stage, he grabbed a knife and fled out the back door. The two officers pursued the man on foot. The pursuit continued into the alley where the suspect turned to confront the officers. Both officers discharged their electronic control devices (ECDs), but the ECDs had no effect. The suspect lunged at the 31-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, with the knife extended. The officers fired their service weapons, striking the suspect. However, before he was hit, the individual was able to stab the 31-year-old officer in the front below the waist (just above the left kneecap). The victim officer justifiably killed the offender at the scene. The 36-year-old offender had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, drug violations, and weapons violations. He had also been convicted previously. The victim officer recovered from his injuries and returned to duty.",749
"The chief of the Grant Police Department was shot and killed at 10:08 a.m. on August 15 while attempting an arrest. The chief was assisting other officers who were picking up from a residence a juvenile who had failed to appear in court. At the residence, the 48-year-old chief and three other officers spoke to the homeowner and proceeded to a back bedroom, calling out to the wanted juvenile. As the chief entered the center of the bedroom, the wanted youth opened fire from his hiding place in a closet with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, fatally striking the 29-year veteran of law enforcement in the front of the head. The wanted juvenile and a second juvenile, who also shot from the closet with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, fired three or four rounds. As a second officer entered the room, he returned fire, striking the juvenile who shot the chief. A third officer returned fire from the doorway, helping to suppress additional shots from the subjects. Both juveniles, who were known drug users and dealers, were under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. The wanted suspect, a 17- year-old on conditional release and pending criminal prosecution at the time of the incident, was hospitalized for two injuries.

"A 37-year-old detective with the San Antonio Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to serve an outstanding arrest warrant on an individual for aggravated assault. Around 1:50 p.m. on September 21, the veteran detective, who had nearly 11 years of law enforcement experience, was called to an apartment building as a member of the Repeat Offenders Program (ROP) to help serve the warrant on a man inside who had allegedly shot his girlfriend in the leg with a shotgun the night before. When the detective arrived with other colleagues from the ROP, they set up loose surveillance of the apartment building. One of the other detectives observed the suspect leaving the apartment complex and radioed to the others to arrest him. As the detective and a uniformed officer approached the suspect, he began to run. A foot chase ensued, and the uniformed officer lost sight of the suspect and the detective as they rounded a corner. The officer and other detectives heard one shot and subsequently found the victim detective on the ground in front of the building. The detective, who was wearing body armor, had received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of the head from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. The officers and detectives took positions of cover in front of the apartment complex and attempted to contact the suspect. After several minutes, the 35-year-old suspect, who had prior convictions that included weapons violations, called to the officers, “Are you ready?” He then exited the building with the shotgun pointed at the officers. The officers fired several shots, striking the suspect in the leg, stomach, and head, killing him.",351
"A 42-year-old corporal with the Dover Police Department died on September 1 from injuries he sustained approximately 5 years earlier during a traffic stop. On February 8, 2012, at 5:17 p.m., the 36-year-old corporal and a probation officer were in an unmarked police vehicle on traffic patrol when they observed a suspicious vehicle. The corporal conducted a computer query on the vehicle’s registration and determined that the driver’s license of the registered owner was suspended. The corporal, who was a veteran officer with nearly 12 years of law enforcement experience, activated his emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle. Both the corporal and the probation officer were wearing body armor and black utility uniforms with the words “police” and “probation officer” on them. The corporal determined that the driver of the vehicle was the registered owner and directed him to exit the vehicle. The corporal advised the driver that his license was suspended, and his vehicle was going to be inventoried and towed. The driver asked to retrieve an item from his vehicle and quickly reentered his car. The corporal followed the driver to his car and reached through the driver’s side door, across the driver, to remove the keys from the ignition. As the corporal was standing beside the vehicle with his head and upper torso inside, the driver put the manual stick shift into gear and pressed the accelerator. The corporal was dragged 15 feet, which caused injuries to the front of both legs/feet, specifically his knees. The driver attempted to remove the corporal from the vehicle, but the corporal wrestled with the driver, took the vehicle out of gear, and gained control of the steering wheel. The corporal removed the driver from the vehicle and took him into custody with the probation officer’s help. A search of the vehicle yielded pills and more than $2,000 in cash. The 31-year-old driver was charged with Second-Degree Assault, Intentionally Injuring a Law Enforcement Officer, Resisting Arrest with Force, and Violence That Injures/Struggles with a Peace Officer. His criminal history included resisting arrest, a drug law violation, and a violent crime.

"Around 11:30 on a summer night in the South, a law enforcement officer, who had 10 years of experience, was working a department-approved overtime detail at a grocery store. At closing time, the manager locked the store and the officer escorted her to her vehicle. As the officer was walking to his vehicle, he heard gunfire. The officer turned to see someone shooting at him. No immediate cover was available, so the officer ran to avoid being shot while attempting to flank the offender. The offender fired five rounds at the officer using a .38 caliber revolver; one round struck the officer in his lower leg. The officer fired 14 rounds at the offender using his service weapon, but no rounds struck the offender. The offender fled the scene and, in the process, discarded his gun behind a business.

The lieutenant, commander, and the agent were all law enforcement veterans, with 23, 28, and 15 years’ experience, respectively. The officer arrived at the police department and asked to speak to a colonel, but was referred to the lieutenant because his request involved administrative issues. The officer entered the lieutenant’s office. When all four were in the office, the officer disarmed the lieutenant and the commander (the agent was not armed). The suspect then threatened the lieutenant with one of the weapons he had taken, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. About this time, two calls were made. The lieutenant called the colonel to explain the suspect was threatening to kill her and the agent with his weapon.

After a request for backup, two additional officers came to assist. One of the four officers attempted to gather further information from the suspect’s parents outside the residence, and the other three officers approached the front doors (which included a screen door and a solid door behind). As the 63-year-old veteran officer attempted to open the screen door, someone inside yelled, “Don’t do it, don’t do it!” The suspect then fired rounds from a .223-caliber rifle through the front door. As the three officers ran for cover, the 27-year-old officer was hit by gunfire and fell to the ground. The officer who was talking to the suspect’s parents took cover at the south side of the residence and radioed that an officer was down. The officers went to retrieve rifles from their patrol units. The 63-year-old officer’s head was bleeding, but he also attempted to get his rifle. In the process, he was struck by gunfire and immediately fell to the ground.

"An officer with the Tucson Police Department (TPD) was shot and killed, and two deputy sheriffs with the Pima County Sheriff’s Department (PCSD) were injured as a result of a felony traffic pursuit on June 1 in Tucson. Shortly before 10 a.m., dispatchers with the PCSD received several calls about a man in camouflage clothing who was shooting at houses. Deputies were dispatched, arrived at the scene at 10:08 a.m., and obtained a description of the man’s vehicle. A 30-year-old PCSD deputy, with nearly 1 year of law enforcement experience, spotted the man’s vehicle. The suspect waved at the deputy and motioned for the deputy to come to him.

"On July 22 approximately 8:40 a.m., a 33-year-old deputy sheriff with the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office (OCSO) was shot and killed while participating in a tactical situation in Fort Walton Beach involving a man whose family was attempting to have him placed in a hospital for psychiatric examination. The man had suffered some mental problems since the death of his father several months prior to the incident on July 22. His family had attempted twice on the previous day to have him involuntarily placed under psychiatric observation, but he had left the hospital twice on his own. He had proven to be verbally abusive and uncooperative to law enforcement and hospital staff involved in both episodes. After the second time he left the hospital, he returned to his father’s house. A family friend in the neighborhood reported contact with the man to his family, and neighbors reported seeing suspicious activity near the property in the very early hours of July 22. They notified authorities that someone appeared to be in the vacant house. When OCSO deputies arrived on the scene, the man’s brother was waiting in a pickup truck at the house. He informed the deputies he and his companion could hear his brother moving about in the house and that his brother had a shotgun in his possession. Deputies searched the area around the residence, set up a perimeter, and attempted to make contact with the man. A second brother of the man arrived on the scene, confirmed that his brother was armed, and provided a key and gave consent for the deputies to enter the residence. At 4:20 a.m., both a Special Response Team (SRT) and a Crisis Negotiation Unit were called out. Details of the case were discussed and further information dispersed, including that the man was no longer in possession of a mobile phone and the house had no phone service. After further efforts to contact the man failed, the decision was made to send in the SRT using a “stealth” entry and quietly conduct a welfare check on the man. The SRT entered with the key and, initially, behind a ballistic shield. The team then moved slowly and methodically through the rooms of the house. The victim deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience, began to search a second bedroom. As the victim deputy and another deputy began to slowly open the door to the room, the second deputy saw a muzzle flash and heard a shot right before the victim deputy fell backwards. The second deputy returned fire. As the second deputy moved, he observed the shooter crossing the room with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. The deputy continued to fire as the suspect dove into a closet. The deputy moved a little further into the doorway and saw the suspect lying on the floor of the closet. Officers began administering aid to the victim deputy who was mortally wounded in the neck above his protective vest. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel transported the deputy to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The EMS also evaluated the condition of the suspect and established that he was dead on the scene. Laboratory analysis later determined that, although the 47-year-old suspect suffered several wounds, the fatal shot was a self-inflicted one from his own shotgun.",865
"On May 5 at 12:35 p.m., a 37-year-old sergeant with the Cottonwood Heights Police Department, a law enforcement veteran with 6 years’ experience, sustained an injury to his arm while responding to a report of a suicide attempt. When the sergeant arrived at the residence, the subject’s sister reported the subject had taken approximately 15 antidepressant pills and had been texting his friends indicating he wanted to kill himself. She forwarded those messages to the sergeant. Another female in the residence led the sergeant upstairs to the subject’s bedroom. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, knocked on the door and called out the subject’s name, but no one answered. The woman opened the door and gave the sergeant permission to enter the bedroom. Since the subject, who outweighed the sergeant by around 70 pounds, was under the influence of antidepressant pills and appeared to be in a hopeless frame of mind, the sergeant decided to wait for backup officers to arrive before engaging him. The subject told the sergeant that he wanted to kill himself because of “all the bad going on around him.” The sergeant tried to convince the subject to leave the bedroom, but the subject refused and said that he would not cooperate with medical personnel. Based upon the statements the subject had made to his sister and friends, the sergeant determined that the subject was a threat to himself and decided to have him involuntarily committed to a hospital. Once backup arrived, the sergeant pulled slightly on the subject’s legs, saying “Let’s go,” as the subject lay on his bed. Simultaneously, a backup officer tried to pull the subject up by his arm. At this point, the subject sat up quickly and stabbed the sergeant in the right inner forearm with a pair of scissors. The sergeant pulled the subject off the bed and onto the floor, and the backup officer positioned himself on the subject’s back in an effort to subdue him; however, the subject refused to relinquish the scissors. The sergeant deployed an electronic control device into the subject’s upper right thigh and again in the subject’s right side. The subject dropped the scissors, and the backup officer handcuffed him. Medical personnel evaluated the subject and transported him to a local medical center. Medical personnel also evaluated and treated the sergeant’s wound at the scene; the sergeant later sought additional treatment at an emergency care facility. After the 20-year-old subject was released from the medical center later that day, officers arrested him and charged him with Aggravated Assault and Interference with a Peace Officer. The sergeant has since recovered from his injury and returned to duty.",923
"A 26-year-old patrol officer with the Youngstown Police Department was shot and killed in an attack about 2:30 a.m. on April 29. Approximately 12:40 a.m., two men were arguing outside a local bar when one of the men pulled out a gun and shot the other man. The shooter then borrowed a friend’s car and fled the scene. The officer, with nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, responded to the shooting, took a report, and obtained a description of the borrowed getaway car. The officer was on patrol around 2:30 a.m. when apparently he came upon what he thought was the vehicle driven by the alleged shooter. The officer stopped his car behind the vehicle at an intersection. He ran a license plate check on the vehicle, but before he received a response, the suspect exited his vehicle and walked back to the police car. The officer opened his door, but before he could react, the suspect shot the officer three times at close range with a .38- caliber revolver. Though the officer’s protective vest stopped one bullet, shots to the front and side of his head proved fatal. The suspect reentered the getaway vehicle and drove off, but abandoned it a short time later. Sources provided Youngstown Police Department with information that the man borrowed another car and drove to Florida. Local law enforcement officers in Clearwater, Florida, FBI Special Agents, and Deputy U.S. Marshals arrested the 30-year-old male at a hotel on April 30. The man, who was on parole and had prior arrests for Arson, Aggravated Menacing, Felonious Assault, and Escape, was charged with Aggravated Murder with Death Penalty Specifications.",236
"A 40-year-old police officer with the Philadelphia Police Department was shot before 6 a.m. on August 18 in an attempted robbery. Upon finishing his shift, the veteran officer, who had more than 19 years of law enforcement experience, left his precinct in plain clothes and began walking toward a bus stop a few blocks away. According to investigative reports, two males approached the off-duty officer and attempted to rob him. Before the officer could retrieve his service weapon, one of the men shot the officer at close range with a .40-caliber handgun, mortally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest. The two men then fled the scene. At 5:52 a.m., law enforcement officers responded to a radio call of a “male down on the highway.” Pedestrians at the scene directed officers to the victim officer, who was lying on the pavement by an empty lot. Responding law enforcement officers observed the victim had been shot and identified him as a police officer. A medic unit transported the victim officer to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6:23 a.m. Subsequent investigation led to the arrest of a 23- year-old suspect on August 24 and a 19-year-old suspect on August 28.

"A 28-year-old officer with the Oshkosh Police Department returned to duty after being injured with a cutting instrument while conducting an investigative activity. The incident began at 4:15 p.m. on October 9 when the officer, a veteran with more than 5 years of law enforcement experience, was interviewing a suspect who had successfully eluded the officer during a traffic stop 4 days earlier. The suspect was also on probation, and a warrant had been issued for his arrest due to a probation violation. The officer, along with his partner, had been searching for the suspect at several locations and finally found him at his mother’s residence. A man answered the door in his underwear and the officers identified him as the suspect they were seeking. The officers asked to speak with him, and the suspect allowed the officers to come inside while he finished dressing. The three men then went back outside, and the suspect sat on the porch steps while officers questioned him about the incidents that had occurred days earlier. After a discussion, the suspect eventually admitted to taking a car without the owner’s consent, eluding police, and later hitting a telephone pole. He told officers he fled from police because he didn’t have a driver’s license, was currently on probation, and had been drinking alcohol. At that point, the suspect asked police if he could go inside the residence to get a drink. The victim officer later stated because of the suspect’s cooperativeness, the officers agreed and followed the suspect inside where he got a glass of water. The three men again returned to the porch area, and the suspect sat on the porch steps. The suspect talked to the officers for another 10-15 minutes about the previous incidents. The suspect requested more water, and the officers refused the request. The officers told the suspect that he was under arrest. Both officers reached for the man to handcuff him. The officer’s partner ordered the man to put his hands behind his back. The officer grabbed the suspect by his wrist/forearm, and immediately the man began to pull away. The suspect jumped off the steps, onto the ground, and struck the officer in the right side of his face with the drinking glass, shattering it and cutting the victim officer’s face and neck; then he attempted to run away. Both officers regained hold of the suspect, and the victim officer radioed dispatch for assistance as a violent struggle ensued that brought all three men to the ground. The officers were ordering the suspect to stop resisting when the suspect began to grab the victim officer’s duty belt in an apparent attempt to take the officer’s service weapon. The officer covered his weapon with both of his hands to prevent the suspect from taking it while alerting his partner of the suspect’s actions. The victim officer shouted for his partner to use the electronic control device (ECD) to subdue the suspect. While the officer’s partner was restraining the suspect, the victim officer managed to remove his ECD from his duty belt and deploy it into the suspect’s side on his bare skin. The suspect continued to fight the officers and attempted to dislodge the ECD’s wires. The victim officer repositioned the ECD onto the suspect’s calf and administered a stun, but it had no effect. The officer discarded the ECD and positioned himself on top of the suspect, who was lying face down on the ground. To create a distraction and attempt to stop the man from resisting, the officer struck the suspect in the face and used his forearm on the back of the suspect’s neck to pin him down. More officers arrived at the scene and assisted in getting the suspect handcuffed while the victim officer attended to his wounds. The suspect continued to resist after he was handcuffed and unsuccessfully attempted to bite the partner officer’s hand. The victim officer sustained significant wounds to the side of his head, neck/throat, and arms/hands from the drinking glass. An ambulance was requested, and the officer was transported to the hospital where he received 13 facial stitches. Medical personnel attended to the 19-year-old suspect at the scene for a bloody nose. He was taken to the hospital and cleared for admission to jail.

"On May 12 at 7:44 a.m., the 46-year-old chief of the Kirkersville Police Department was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack. Earlier that morning, an individual, who was on conditional release pending criminal prosecution, took two hostages into the woods near a nursing and rehabilitation center. He informed the hostages that he intended to kill a woman in the facility and then himself because of their domestic issues. One of the hostages surreptitiously called 911 and left the line open. The dispatcher notified the chief and the Licking County Sheriff’s Office (LCSO). When the chief, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene, he parked in front of the individual’s location in the woods and reported to dispatch that he “had a visual on the suspect.” A hostage later reported that when the chief exited his vehicle, the man stood up and shot one round from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun at the chief, striking him in the neck/throat above his body armor. Deputies from the LCSO found the chief on the ground behind his patrol vehicle. A deputy transported him to another location before he was taken by emergency services personnel to a hospital where he succumbed to his injury. The offender, armed with the shotgun and a handgun, entered the facility, shot and killed two female employees, then committed suicide.

The deputy, who had more than 6 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence of the 911 caller around 3:30 p.m. The caller said her son was at a neighbor’s home and was acting strangely. The deputy drove to the neighbor’s home, and when the deputy knocked on the front door, a man opened the door and shot at her with a .44 magnum lever-action rifle. The deputy immediately returned fire from the top step near the door. The deputy retreated to her locked patrol car and finally to a nearby tree while returning fire. The deputy exhausted the ammunition in her three magazines, becoming incapacitated and unable to return fire. The suspect then approached her and shot her once in the head at close range. In addition to the fatal head wound, the deputy, who was wearing a protective vest, suffered 9 gunshot wounds to the front upper torso, below the waist, and in her arms/hands. The shooter continued his killing spree resulting in five dead and four wounded individuals.

Police received information on the whereabouts of the wanted subject, and two detectives spotted him entering a residence in the area. Additional law enforcement personnel responded to the location in an unmarked vehicle, then entered the residence to find the subject. After searching the first floor for 10 minutes, they formulated a plan to search the remainder of the house. The officer, an 18-year law enforcement veteran, slowly ascended the winding rear staircase. He was wearing a uniform, body armor, and a body camera. The stairs turned as they went upward, so the top of the staircase was not in view from the bottom. As the officer neared the top of the staircase, he saw a pile of clothing on the landing above him.
