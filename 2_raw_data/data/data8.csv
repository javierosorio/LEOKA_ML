"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence.

"On August 12 around 3:40 p.m., a 33-year-old patrol officer with the Hatch Police Department was fatally wounded while making a traffic stop. The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process. Eventually, all three suspects were apprehended. Two of the men were wanted in connection with a murder in Ohio. In addition, 62 grams of methamphetamine were found in the suitcase of one of the suspects.

"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased.

The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene.

On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected.

As the 46-year-old officer, who had 10 years of law enforcement experience, went to the trunk of his car to get his rifle, the suspect came to the glass doors, opened one of them, and began firing. The veteran officer was hit in the upper back; however, the bullet did not penetrate his body armor. Both officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who retreated into the shop. Moments later, most of the employees exited a side door. The suspect exited the same side door and jogged down an alley headed towards the rear of the building. At this time, the sergeant, a 27-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived in his marked patrol vehicle behind the suspect. The suspect turned and fired one round through the passenger side windshield of the sergeant’s vehicle. The sergeant struck the suspect with his vehicle; the suspect hit the hood and landed against the windshield, crushing it in. The sergeant stopped his vehicle and the suspect rolled off, knocking the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his hand. The suspect got up and ran, and the sergeant exited his vehicle and chased after him. As the suspect rounded a street corner, the sergeant deployed an electronic control device (ECD) and fired two darts at the suspect’s back. The ECD did not affect the suspect because he was wearing body armor. The suspect continued running, and according to a witness, he unzipped his jacket and pulled out a second weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The sergeant, who was also wearing a protective vest, drew his service weapon, and a gun battle ensued between the two men who were separated by less than 8 feet. As the sergeant attempted to reload his weapon, he was hit in the front of the head and died instantly. The suspect was hit in his chest, but his protective armor prevented any of the rounds from penetrating his body. He was also believed to have gunshot injuries to his groin area, but they did not incapacitate him. The suspect was walking away as the two officers who had first responded came upon the victim sergeant. The suspect shot at the officers, who returned fire, striking the back of his neck and his body armor. He dropped his weapon, tried to continue walking, but collapsed to the ground. The officers approached the suspect and handcuffed him. The 25-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with Felony Murder, First-Degree Murder, three counts of Attempted First-Degree Murder, and Aggravated Robbery. The officer injured in the first moments of the incident was transported to the hospital due to blunt trauma where the bullet impacted his body armor. He was later released and has since returned to duty.",1109
"On June 20, a police officer with the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) was killed while transporting a prisoner. At 8:20 a.m., the 45-year-old veteran officer, who had more than 22 years of law enforcement experience, was transporting an individual to jail. The man had been arrested earlier that morning for aggravated assault following a domestic dispute with his wife. Seated in the rear of the patrol vehicle, the man managed to maneuver his hands, which were handcuffed, from behind his back to the front of his body. He then retrieved a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun that he had hidden on his person and pointed the gun at the officer through the sliding window that separated the front and rear seats. The individual fired a single round from the handgun at close range, striking the veteran officer in the right front upper torso/chest. The police vehicle then crashed into a light pole. Once it stopped, the suspect squeezed through the small sliding window and exited the vehicle through the front passenger door, leaving the weapon on the vehicle’s floor. The incident took approximately 12 seconds and was captured by the interior camera of the patrol vehicle. The victim officer was taken to a hospital where he died 30 minutes later. A massive manhunt for the suspect ensued. Local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies searched for the suspect throughout the day. At approximately 9 a.m. on June 21, a patrol unit spotted the suspect boarding a city bus. When the patrol officers stopped the bus, the suspect tried to flee, but the NOPD captured him. He was still wearing handcuffs, but the chain had been cut. The 33-year-old suspect, who was on parole at the time of the incident, was charged with First-Degree Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer, Aggravated Escape, and Weapons Law Violations. He was known to deal drugs and was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. He had a criminal history that included police assault, a violent crime, and a drug law violation.",885
"At 8:10 p.m. on May 11, a 50-year-old sergeant with the Savannah Police Department (SPD) was shot and killed while investigating an armed robbery. The sergeant, a 10-year veteran of law enforcement, was called to a business’ parking lot where an armed robbery had occurred an hour prior, around 7 p.m. The suspect initially fled the scene, but the 911 caller reported that the suspect had returned. The sergeant and two SPD officers arrived at the area and observed the suspect sitting in a vehicle in the parking lot near where the robbery occurred. Body camera footage of the incident shows that when the suspect saw the officers approaching, he exited the vehicle and fired three rounds from a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the officers, fatally striking the sergeant in his waist/groin area, below his body armor. A 40-year-old police officer (with nearly 1 year of law enforcement experience) was also wounded in the front of his leg during the shooting. The suspect fled the scene on foot with the third SPD officer in pursuit. A bystander directed the pursuing officer where the suspect had fled, and the officer found the suspect exiting a shed in a nearby backyard, still brandishing the weapon. The officer fired three rounds from his patrol rifle, striking the suspect. The downed suspect was taken to a nearby medical center, where he died of his injuries. The victim sergeant was transported to the hospital as well, where he succumbed to his wounds later that night. The injured police officer, who was also wearing body armor during the incident, was treated for his gunshot wound and released. At the time of the incident, the suspect was on parole and had a criminal history that included aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, robbery, resisting arrest, and a weapons violation. He was known by the agency to be a drug dealer and a violent offender.",710
"Around 10 o'clock on a winter night in the South, an officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, left his office for the night. While driving, he came upon an officer who was conducting a traffic stop, so he slowed down to assist. Just as the officer approached the stopped vehicle, the driver accelerated in an attempt to flee.  Both officers began pursuing the vehicle. A number of officers from different law enforcement agencies joined the chase, which lasted several minutes. The officers knew the identity of the 16-year-old driver and deduced from the direction in which he was traveling that he was driving to his residence. As suspected, the driver stopped at his  house, where he and three companions exited the vehicle and ran inside. The officers pursued the suspects into the residence, where they encountered several family members. One officer detained two combative females in the laundry area as the other officer, who had 7 years of law enforcement experience, began questioning relatives in another section of the home. Unknown to the officers, the offender had obtained a single-shot, 16-gauge shotgun from his bedroom. The offender approached from behind the officer who was questioning relatives and shot him in the head, killing him. The offender dropped the firearm and ran back into his bedroom. He was eventually arrested, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison.",1235
"Approximately 3:30 on a warm spring afternoon in the Midwest, two uniformed officers, each with 1 year of law enforcement experience, arrived at the parking lot of their precinct to begin their tours of duty. The officers walked together through the parking lot and passed a white box-type delivery truck parked near their building. Unknown to the officers, a 24-year-old offender had just shot and killed the driver of the delivery truck at a nearby store, stole the vehicle, and drove it to the police precinct with the intent to shoot and kill �police officers. Both officers were at the precinct's rear entrance when the offender approached them from behind and said, Hey guys, how are you doing? He immediately began firing at the officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The first officer was struck in the hand, causing him to fall to the ground. The offender then turned to the second officer and shot him in the face. The offender turned his attention back to the first officer and shot him in the head, killing him. As the offender retreated to the delivery truck, the second officer retrieved his service weapon and began firing at  the offender. A round struck the offender, but he made it to the delivery truck and attempted to drive away. The incident occurred during a shift change, so several officers quickly responded. A shootout ensued, and the offender was justifiably killed. The injured officer later recovered from his injuries and returned to full duty.",1226
"On August 28, just before 8:30 p.m., a 47-year-old deputy sheriff with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack. The veteran deputy, with nearly 9 years of law enforcement experience, had just finished a call at the scene of an accident when he stopped at a convenience store, parked near a gas pump, and went inside. As he left the convenience store and walked to his police car, surveillance video showed a man exit a truck, walk up behind the victim deputy, and shoot him in the rear of the head. The victim deputy, who was wearing body armor, fell to the ground, and the subject continued to fire at him until he emptied the .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun of 15 rounds. The assailant then returned to his truck and left. The victim deputy, who not only suffered a fatal wound to the rear of his head, but also suffered wounds to his neck/throat and the rear upper torso/back, died at the scene of the shooting. Later that evening, a 30-year-old suspect, with a criminal history including a violent crime, a weapons violation, and police assault, was arrested at a residence near the convenience store.

The suspect was charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.",806
"A 53-year-old veteran officer with the New Orleans Police Department died July 10 from injuries sustained in an incident nearly 20 years earlier. The officer, then 33 years old with more than 14 years of experience, was with one of several police units responding to a burglary in progress at a home at 3:30 p.m., March 18, 1985. He was securing an alley adjacent to the residence when a man opened a window of the home near where the officer was standing. The man attempted to get out of the house through the window apparently to evade other officers at the front and rear of the home. Upon seeing the officer in the alley, the man shot him twice at close range with a .357-magnum revolver he had taken from the residence. The suspect then jumped from the window and ran toward the backyard, where he apparently dropped the gun. He crossed neighboring properties by jumping several fences, including one around a swimming pool into which he fell. Officers in pursuit apprehended him in a courtyard of an apartment complex. The victim officer, who had bullet wounds in his neck and in the front of his head, was transported via police vehicle to a local medical facility. Several days later, surgeons removed a bullet from the back of his neck. Though shortly after the incident his condition showed improvement, the officer subsequently lapsed into a coma that lasted until his death. Police charged the perpetrator, who was 18 years old at the time of the incident, with Attempted First-Degree Murder, Use of a Firearm in the Commission of a Felony, and Aggravated Burglary. According to police reports, the suspect confirmed his involvement in the burglary and the shooting.",470
"About 1:20 p.m. on August 28, a 46-year-old patrol officer with the Sebewaing Police Department was assaulted with his service weapon while handling and transporting a prisoner in Hampton Township. The veteran officer, who had more than 21 years of law enforcement experience, went to a residence to pick up a youth who was the subject of a juvenile detainer. The officer planned to transport him to a juvenile detention center in another county. At the residence, the officer handcuffed (double locked) the juvenile’s hands in the front and placed him in the backseat of the vehicle. When they arrived at the detention center, the officer exited the vehicle and opened the rear door. The juvenile, who was able to slip one of his hands out of the handcuffs, attacked the officer and attempted to grab the officer’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic revolver. The officer, who was wearing body armor, attempted to maintain control of his weapon; as they struggled, the handgun discharged. The officer was hit in the arms/hands. The juvenile gained control of the weapon, and the officer took cover behind parked vehicles at the detention center. The juvenile ran a short distance across the parking lot, then stopped and shot himself in the head.

"Just before 6:30 pm on June 18, a 32-year-old patrol officer with the Floyd County Police Department was killed and a backup officer was wounded in an ambush situation. The patrol officer and the 27-year- old backup officer were dispatched to a residence after a woman had reported finding marijuana in her home. She had confronted her teenage son about the drugs, and he became abusive to her. When the first responding officer, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence, he was met in the driveway by the teenager’s mother and aunt, who reported that the youth had armed himself with a rifle and was possibly suicidal. Realizing the suspect was armed and may have taken a superior position in the house, the officer instructed the two women to move down the driveway and away from the home. Immediately after the backup officer arrived at the scene, gunshots were fired from an upstairs bedroom window of the home. As the officers and the women moved toward the rear of the police cars to take cover, both officers were wounded from shots from a .30-06-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The backup officer was shot in the lower back below his protective vest. The patrol officer was shot in the leg and in the lower back, with a round penetrating his vest.

"A 43-year-old deputy sheriff with the Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s Office (PCSO) was killed, and a 59- year-old deputy sheriff with the PCSO was wounded in Council Bluffs while transporting prisoners at 10:55 a.m. on May 1. The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail. The male prisoner exited the back of the van and immediately began assaulting the 43-year-old deputy, a 16-year law enforcement veteran, with a homemade cutting instrument, cutting the deputy’s head, neck, arms/hands, and front legs/feet. With the deputy down, the suspect ran to the driver’s seat of the van. The injured deputy, who was wearing body armor, recovered and entered the van through the front passenger’s side door. The 59-year-old deputy, who was also wearing body armor, ran to the driver’s side of the van to attempt to apprehend the suspect. During the struggle, the suspect gained possession of one of the deputy’s service weapons, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The suspect fatally shot the injured 43-year-old deputy in the side of the head with the service weapon. The suspect then shot the 59-year-old deputy in the front lower torso/abdomen below his protective vest and took possession of the other deputy’s service weapon. The injured 59-year-old deputy fell to the ground outside the van. The suspect exited the van and took the van keys and extra ammunition from the 59-year-old deputy.

At 10:57 a.m., the suspect pulled up behind two motorists in a pickup truck at an intersection. The truck driver noticed the suspect exiting the van dressed in a yellow jumpsuit carrying a firearm and realized the man was an escaped prisoner. As the suspect attempted to open the driver’s side door of the truck, the truck driver tried to drive away, but the suspect fired one round through the truck’s window, striking the driver in the neck. The injured motorist continued driving until he drove into a ditch north of the intersection. The suspect returned to the van and fled.

The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First- Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

An apparently disabled vehicle was parked along a state highway near Waldo Township, and the veteran deputy, who had nearly 8 years of law enforcement experience, asked the dispatcher to contact a nearby gas station to learn if anyone had reported the abandoned vehicle. The gas station clerk informed the dispatcher, who, in turn, informed the officer, that two men had purchased gas a short time before and had left on foot. The deputy then spotted a man walking toward the vehicle and apparently had a conversation with him. The officer, who was wearing body armor, informed the dispatcher that he was going to give the man a ride to an apartment complex in Marion. The dispatcher ran a check on the information that the man had provided to the deputy and found that the man had given a false name and date of birth. The dispatcher tried to contact the officer numerous times via radio, cellular phone, and pager to warn him about the man, but none of the attempts to contact him were successful.

"Two veteran police officers with the Mamaroneck Police Department (MPD) were stabbed and injured while answering a call for service on the afternoon of April 28. At 1:29 p.m., an MPD dispatcher received a 911 call from a frantic woman reporting someone was dying at a residence. The dispatcher sent all MPD units and an ambulance to the residence. Multiple officers responded around the same time and encountered a woman who was crying hysterically and saying “my daughter, my grandbaby” repeatedly. She led officers to a side door and gave them the keys to unlock it, as her hands were shaking too badly to do it herself. A group of four officers entered the kitchen, and one of them announced “police” loudly multiple times. In an attempt to clear the house, the officers split up. A 33-year-old police officer, who had 9 years of law enforcement experience, went downstairs with his weapon drawn to secure the basement, where he observed blood spots on the wet floor and a bathtub filled with bloody water in a bathroom. At the same time upstairs, officers walked down a hallway where they saw two closed doors and a number of handwritten notes stuck to the walls with unclear phrases written on them. They opened the first door and found a small, unresponsive child covered by a small blanket or towel and lying on a bed. Her cover included a note that appeared to ask God to accept “my baby.” The 53-year- old officer, who had 17 years of law enforcement experience, immediately started performing CPR on the child and radioed for EMS assistance; the other two officers continued clearing the house. The officers opened the second closed door and encountered a woman standing in the darkened bedroom holding both hands behind her back. She had a bleeding cut on her neck and was staring blankly at the officers. They repeatedly ordered the woman to show her hands, but she did not comply or speak. Additional officers arrived at the scene. Another officer switched places with the 53-year-old officer, and took over performing CPR on the child. The 53-year-old officer then entered the second bedroom with his weapon drawn and ordered the woman to show her hands and get on the floor. The officer had a light mounted on his firearm, which helped him clearly see the woman. As the 53-year-old officer started to switch his firearm for an electronic control device, the woman raised her hands above her head, clutching a large knife in each hand, and ran toward the officers. By this time, the 33-year-old officer had cleared the downstairs and joined the other officers. He and another officer deployed their electronic control devices, striking the suspect in her middle back and side. However, the shock had no effect on the woman. The suspect charged the officers, wildly swinging both knives. The officers backed away and used their arms to deflect the knives, then tripped and fell to the ground. The offender continued to slash at the officers, while they tried to kick the knives away from her. A third officer fired three rounds at the suspect, striking her twice and stopping her attack. The 53-year-old officer suffered a laceration to his left hand, and the 33-year-old officer was stabbed in the foot. Emergency services personnel arrived and began treating the injured offender while the 53-year-old officer returned to the child, who had no pulse, and began chest compressions again. Other officers began clearing the house. Another officer took over CPR on the child, while the 53-year-old officer returned to his patrol unit to retrieve his K-9 partner to help clear the building. On the second floor, the K-9 picked up the scent of a person behind a closed, locked door. An unarmed man exited the room with his hands up, and the officer handcuffed him. Officers later determined the man was a tenant and had nothing to do with the incident. Emergency personnel cleaned and bandaged both officers’ wounds and removed the deceased child to a waiting ambulance. Both officers went to a local hospital where they were treated and released. They have since returned to duty. The 28-year-old suspect, who was the mother of the deceased child, was arrested and charged with Second-Degree Murder, Second-Degree Assault, and Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer. She had no prior criminal record, but she was known to law enforcement for previous domestic violence calls.",1061

One officer shot pepper spray through an opening in one of the vehicle’s windows while another officer, who was wearing body armor, broke out the passenger window. The subject pulled a semiautomatic handgun from behind his back and fired at the officer who had broken the window’s glass, striking the officer in his front upper torso/chest. The officer also suffered an eye injury (front head). Another officer fired at the subject, justifiably killing him. The subject was later discovered to have a history of a mental illness and a prior criminal record. The victim officer had not returned to duty at the time this incident was reported to the FBI.",779
"On October 21, shortly after 10 p.m., a 31-year-old police officer with the Girard Police Department (GPD) was shot and killed while answering a call for service. Two officers with the GPD responded to a report of an intoxicated man who had been involved in a domestic dispute earlier in the day and was now firing a weapon inside a dwelling. The subject’s live-in girlfriend fled the house and called police. The officer and his partner arrived at the residence and confronted the suspect. The officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 5 years of experience, took out his notebook to write down the suspect’s information. At that point, the suspect produced a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and shot the officer once in the front upper torso/chest. The officer’s partner justifiably shot and killed the 37-year-old suspect. The injured officer was transported to a local hospital where he died in surgery. The suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, was known to the department for prior arrests for assault and domestic violence.",942
"On the morning of January 12, a 24-year-old officer with the San Bernardino Police Department was assaulted and injured while responding to a traffic pursuit. The officer, with 2 years of law enforcement experience, responded to assist another officer who was attempting to pull over a vehicle that did not signal before a turn. The driver would not yield, and a 3-mile chase ensued. During the pursuit, a license plate check revealed the vehicle had been reported stolen. The suspect stopped the vehicle and fled on foot through the backyard of a residence, throwing a handgun aside as he ran. The officers chased the suspect until the assisting officer tackled him. The suspect refused to surrender or follow verbal commands and repeatedly struck the assisting officer with his fists. At one point, the suspect stabbed the victim officer, who was wearing body armor, in the arms/hands with a cutting instrument (scissors). The officers then administered empty-hand techniques to control the suspect, who was finally subdued and taken into custody. The 28-year-old suspect, who was on parole and had a prior criminal record , including a violent crime, weapons violation, and drug law violation, was charged with Assault with a Deadly Weapon on a Law Enforcement Officer, Grand Theft Auto, Felon in Possession of a Firearm, and Felony Evading.",172
"Shortly after 3 p.m. on May 18, a 34-year-old officer with the Phoenix Police Department was shot in an ambush (entrapment and premeditation) and later died. Around 2:30 p.m., a man placed a 911 call about a burglary. The man said his son had broken into his residence and stolen a gun. He also said he received a text from his son that stated he would shoot it out with the police if they were called. The caller also reported his son was under the influence of narcotics. The officer, a law enforcement veteran of nearly 12 years, was among seven officers who gathered near the suspect’s home. They observed a vehicle with tinted windows in the driveway matching the description the father provided for the suspect’s vehicle. The officers, in marked police units, converged on the home to set up a perimeter. The suspect, who was sitting in the driver’s seat of the vehicle in the driveway, fired a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at the first officer to exit his vehicle. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, was shot in the back of the head and in the rear below his waist. He immediately dropped to the ground. The other officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect until he ceased firing. The 20-year-old offender, who had no known criminal history, died at the scene.

The victim officer was then taken by ambulance to a local hospital where he died early the next day from the gunshot wound to the back of his head.",980
"On February 4, a former investigator from the Orange County Sheriff’s Department died as a result of complications from injuries he sustained more than 29 years earlier while investigating suspicious activity in a mall parking lot. Around 8:30 p.m. on November 6, 1980, the investigator and his partner traveled to a mall in the City of Orange to collect bail on a warrant. At that time, the investigator was 39 years old and an 8-year veteran of law enforcement. While driving their unmarked car through the lot, the investigators noticed three men tampering with a parked car. Two of the men were working under the hood, and a third man was inside the vehicle. The investigator and his partner were approaching the men on foot when the man inside the car opened the passenger door and pointed a handgun at the partner. The investigator removed his service weapon from his ankle holster and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. The man then turned and pointed his gun toward the investigator. The suspects at the front of the vehicle also drew weapons, and a gun battle erupted. The investigator was struck in the torso by two rounds fired from a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Two of the offenders fled in the investigators’ unmarked vehicle, while the other offender fled on foot. While pursuing them in a high- speed car chase, California Highway Patrol units received gunfire from the two suspects. During the pursuit, the suspects lost control and crashed the unmarked unit, allowing officers to capture the two men and take them into custody. The man who escaped on foot was apprehended within days in Las Vegas, Nevada. The bullets that struck the investigator during the gun battle paralyzed him from the chest down. Over the next 29 years, he was confined to a wheelchair and required numerous medical procedures to address complications from his injuries. The three suspects were all on parole at the time of the shooting and were attempting to steal a vehicle to serve as a get-away car for a planned robbery. At the time of the incident, all three offenders were convicted of Attempted Murder and served prison sentences.",842
"On October 21 at 2:10 a.m., a 30-year-old canine police officer with the University of Mississippi Police Department was killed while assisting an officer with a traffic stop in Oxford. Although the responding officer had initiated the stop on the university’s grounds, the driver was pulled over at an off-campus convenience store for speeding. When the responding officer requested to see proof of insurance, the individual put the vehicle in reverse and backed toward the patrol vehicles. He then attempted to flee the scene. The backup officer, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, tried to stop the man from leaving by reaching into the driver’s window. The officer became entangled with the vehicle, and the man drove away, dragging the victim officer for several feet. Eventually, the victim officer became disentangled from the vehicle and fell to the pavement where he suffered a fatal head trauma. The victim officer also suffered injuries in the front of his body below the waist and on his arms/hands. He was transported to a local hospital and was then taken via helicopter to a hospital in Tennessee where he was pronounced dead later that day. The offender left the scene and drove to an apartment complex where he attempted to crash through an electronic entry gate. However, his vehicle became stuck in a ditch, and he abandoned it. He then walked to a friend’s apartment within the complex, called his parents, and told them that he had dragged a police officer with his vehicle. The offender’s parents called the Oxford Police Department. Shortly thereafter, responding officers arrived at the apartment and arrested the 20-year-old man without incident. The offender, who had a prior criminal record and who was allegedly under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time of the incident, was arrested and charged with Capital Murder.",940
"A 29-year-old detective corporal was killed and a 37-year-old patrol officer was injured when the pair, both from the Polk County Police Department, answered a call for service at 10:46 a.m. on September 29. The officer, who had less than 1 year of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a driveway in Cedartown. No passengers were in the parked vehicle, and a check of its registration showed the car had been reported stolen. The officer found a wallet in the vehicle with a woman’s identification card, Social Security card, and a credit or debit card. He did not yet have experience processing the paperwork associated with recovering a stolen vehicle, so he radioed for assistance. The detective, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 9 years of experience, radioed she was en route to help. The officer began work on his report as he sat in his marked patrol unit waiting on the detective and a tow truck to arrive. He soon heard footsteps in the leaves behind the vehicle. He leaned forward to get a better view of the area behind him when he saw a male and a female approaching the vehicle from the rear passenger side. The officer exited the patrol unit and asked the couple why they were in the area. The male pointed to the stolen vehicle and said they were there to retrieve the female’s wallet. The officer asked the female her name, and it matched the name on the items from the wallet. The detective arrived on the scene as the officer was instructing the pair to put their belongings on the ground. The male and female were leaning over very slowly and acting suspiciously as they placed their belongings on the ground when the male produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired two rounds at the officer from approximately 18 feet away. Both rounds struck the officer in his front upper torso/chest but were stopped by his body armor—one of the rounds hit his radio before striking the vest, rendering his radio useless. The officer fell to his knees and fired five rounds from his service weapon. None of the rounds struck the male, who had taken cover in front of the officer’s patrol unit. The male then moved to the passenger side of the car and fired four rounds at the detective. All four rounds struck the detective fatally in her front upper torso/chest, and she fell to the ground. The male then fired two additional rounds at the officer. After realizing his shoulder radio had been destroyed by a bullet, the wounded officer crawled to his patrol unit, quickly assessed the detective’s condition, and used the patrol unit’s radio to call for help. The two subjects appeared to have fled, so the wounded officer rapidly retrieved his shotgun from the trunk of the patrol unit and attempted to give the victim detective CPR until other personnel arrived, all while keeping watch for the subjects in case they returned. The victim detective succumbed to her injuries, and the injured officer was transported to a local hospital. The 31-year-old male offender was arrested later that day and charged with Malice Murder, Felony Murder, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, Theft by Receiving Stolen Property, Aggravated Assault Against a Police Officer During Official Duties, and Willful Obstruction of a Law Enforcement Officer by Use of Threats or Violence. He was on probation at the time of the incident; his criminal history included a drug law violation and a violent crime. The wounded patrol officer was treated and released from the hospital and has returned to duty.",259
"Two police officers with the Westerville Division of Police were killed in an ambush on February 10 shortly after noon. The officers were responding to a 911 hang-up call that involved potential domestic abuse. Officers from the division had previously responded to calls about domestic disputes at the property, which was located in a condominium community. As they entered the apartment, the occupant immediately began firing from an unknown caliber handgun, and the two officers, who were both wearing body armor, returned gunfire. The offender fired four rounds. Three rounds struck the 39- year-old officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 17 years’ experience. He was injured in his arms and hands and fatally in the front of his head and died at the scene. One round struck the second officer, age 54, who was a 30-year law enforcement veteran. The round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

He was charged with two counts of Aggravated Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.",1055
"A 47-year-old police officer with the Houston Police Department (HPD) was killed on May 18 while assisting in a traffic pursuit. Shortly before 3 a.m., officers responded to an attempted burglary of an automated teller machine (ATM). On their way to the scene, officers witnessed a commercial moving van speeding, making an illegal U-turn, and running a red light. As officers pursued the van, the driver fired a weapon multiple times toward them. The suspect eventually left the highway, drove to an adjacent road, stopped the van, and got out. He approached the driver of another vehicle, stole her vehicle at gunpoint, and continued to flee. One of the responding officers, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor, was positioned near the expected path of the suspect. While the officer was deploying a tire-deflation device across the roadway, he was struck by the fleeing vehicle causing fatal injuries. The suspect stopped the vehicle a few miles later, and officers on the scene heard a gunshot from within the vehicle. Responding officers set up a perimeter around the vehicle and waited for the HPD SWAT team to arrive. When the SWAT officers arrived, they approached the vehicle and found the 33-year-old suspect inside with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Officers recovered a shotgun and a handgun from the scene. Investigation later revealed that the hit-and-run suspect was probably not involved with the attempted burglary of the ATM but was driving erratically because the moving van was stolen. The suspect had a prior criminal record including a violent crime, a drug law violation, and a weapons violation. Shortly after 10 a.m. on June 24, a 38-year-old sergeant with the Hutto Police Department (HPD) was killed while attempting to make an arrest. Earlier that morning, another HPD officer observed a speeding vehicle and pursued the vehicle into a residential neighborhood but slowed the chase due to safety concerns. The officer caught up to the vehicle after it had wrecked into a fire hydrant. The driver exited the vehicle and fled on foot. The HPD sergeant, an 8-year veteran of law enforcement, was on patrol that morning wearing his uniform and body armor. The sergeant radioed that he would go to the area where the suspect was likely headed and look for him. When the sergeant radioed that he believed he had the suspect, additional HPD officers left the scene of the vehicle crash and went to assist the sergeant. As they arrived, the officers witnessed the suspect in the driver’s seat of the unmarked patrol unit and the sergeant standing at the driver’s door struggling with the suspect. The suspect put the patrol unit in reverse, with the wheels turned to the right, and then accelerated quickly, knocking the sergeant backward onto the ground and then backing over him. The suspect then put the patrol unit in drive and headed south. One of the responding officers exited his patrol vehicle to aid the sergeant, and the other officer pursued the stolen patrol vehicle. The suspect abandoned the unmarked patrol unit at an intersection and then fled on foot. The pursuing officer located the suspect and noticed that he had a hand restraint on his right wrist. The suspect jumped over a fence and began running through yards in an attempt to elude the officer. The officer continued his pursuit on the opposite side of the fence until an assisting HPD officer intercepted the subject. The assisting officer drew his duty weapon and yelled at the suspect to get on the ground. The man complied, and the officer finished placing the hand restraints on the suspect. The officer who stayed with the victim sergeant radioed that he had started CPR and requested emergency personnel; however, the victim sergeant died from severe head trauma. The 26- year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a drug law violation, was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon on a Public Servant.",440

Upon arriving at the scene, the veteran officer, who had over 14 years of law enforcement experience, observed one of the suspects involved in the disturbance leaving the restaurant and followed him to an adjacent street. As the officer attempted to take the man into custody, he resisted and produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired at the officer, striking him and knocking him to the ground. The officer was able to return fire and struck the suspect in the lower abdomen. The suspect fired a second time at the victim officer, wounding him in the chest above his protective vest and fatally in the front of his head. The shooter fled on foot.

"On the evening of October 1, an off-duty police officer with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department died in a mass shooting. The 34-year-old officer was attending a music festival with his wife and friends. Shortly after 10 p.m., the police department received a call reporting gunfire at the festival. Uniformed officers working the event confirmed that several people had been shot and requested assistance. In an interview on October 18, the officer’s wife reported their group, seated on the east side of the venue, began hearing pops. She thought they were fireworks, but the officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with almost 12 years’ experience, knew it was gunshots. He immediately positioned himself in front of her and their friends to shield them. The officer instructed the group to lie down and calmed them and other festival attendees in his vicinity. As the officer attempted to remove his companions from the venue, a round from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle struck him, and he fell to the ground. There were several volleys of gunfire, and another round struck the officer as he was on the ground. Meanwhile, the police discovered an offender on an upper floor of a hotel overlooking the venue who was shooting at the festival attendees below. Hotel security informed police of the offender’s exact location after he shot a hotel security guard. Police officers made their way to the hotel room and breached the door. There they found the 64-year-old offender lying on the floor dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound from a handgun. They also recovered 23 rifles from the hotel room. Investigation revealed the offender had fired more than 1,000 rounds in all. Officials located, documented, and recovered 31 victims from the venue and its exterior perimeter, and emergency personnel transported the remaining victims to various local hospitals. The officer’s body was located at one such hospital with a fatal gunshot wound to the front upper torso/chest and another shot to the rear upper torso/back.

"A deputy sheriff with the Turner County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed around 9:15 a.m. on March 15 while responding to a call regarding a possible suicide attempt. The 32-year-old deputy sheriff, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the rural residence and attempted to make contact with a 19-year-old male, whose welfare was in question. The deputy entered a bathroom in the home and located the male holding a .30-06 bolt-action rifle. The man shot at the deputy, and the bullet grazed the deputy’s left shoulder, hitting beyond the edge of his body armor. The deputy returned fire and retreated toward his patrol vehicle as the man shot at him two more times. One bullet struck the front door post of the patrol vehicle and the other round went through the windshield and struck the deputy fatally in the neck. The 19-year-old suspect telephoned the Mitchell Police Department from the residence, claimed he had shot the deputy in self-defense, and then fled the scene. When emergency personnel arrived, they found the deputy deceased on the ground next to his patrol vehicle. Approximately 3 hours later, the suspect, who had a prior criminal record and who was a known drug user, surrendered to law enforcement officials.

"A 37-year-old sergeant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was killed and a 35-year-old detective was injured while responding to a domestic disturbance on February 1 at 1:20 in the afternoon. A helicopter unit was the first to respond to the call and relayed that there were several individuals outside of a residence. Just prior to the sergeant’s arrival, one man walked away from the house and another man went inside. The veteran sergeant, with nearly 16 years of law enforcement experience, and a uniformed primary officer were in the street in front of the residence when a radio broadcast was made indicating that the suspect in the original domestic disturbance report was in custody at a nearby location. It was later determined that this person was actually a witness to the incident and not a suspect. The sergeant and primary officer approached the open front door of the residence while other responding officers detained people outside. Inside, a man had created a concealed firing position by overturning a couch at the top of the stairway adjacent to the front door. As the officers entered, the man, armed with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle, fired multiple rounds, striking the sergeant in the chest and back. The victim sergeant managed to exit the house and fell on the porch 10 feet outside of the home. The primary officer returned fire, and the suspect moved to a second floor window where he had previously constructed a firing platform. He fired at the officers and patrol cars below. When officers returned fire at the suspect, he moved to another window and fired again. The detective, who had nearly 9 years of law enforcement experience, began firing at the suspect with an AR-15 rifle. The detective, who was wearing a tactical vest, was struck in his left leg by a round fired by the suspect. Despite his injuries, he remained engaged in the gun battle. The 21-year-old suspect emerged from the front door and began firing rounds at the victim sergeant who was still lying on the porch and inflicted a fatal wound to the rear of the sergeant’s head. After retreating inside the dwelling for a brief period of time, the shooter, a known drug user with a criminal history and who was under the influence of narcotics, reemerged firing his rifle at the officers. During the ensuing 8-minute gun battle in which the offender fired 49 shots, he was killed by return gunfire from the six armed officers.",357
"On November 18, two veteran patrol officers with the Ridgewood Police Department (Ridgewood PD) sustained injuries while handling a person with a mental illness. Shortly after 2 p.m., the two officers, a 42-year-old with nearly 15 years of law enforcement experience and a 33-year-old with nearly 9 years of experience, responded to a disturbance call from a residential mental health center. When officers arrived on scene along with a Ridgewood PD sergeant, a case worker explained a resident was agitated and had insinuated that he might burn down the center. The case worker explained to the officers he had called an operator at the local psychiatric emergency screening program and requested a screener to evaluate the resident. However, the operator advised the case worker that screeners were not available at that time and suggested he call the police instead. The officers located the resident in his bedroom on the second floor and explained the reason they were called. When the resident became agitated once again, the officers suggested that they escort him to the hospital for an evaluation. While the two officers continued to speak to the resident, the sergeant again contacted the emergency screening program. An operator confirmed that no one was available to come to the center to provide a screening. The operator also told the sergeant that following a previous violent crime, a superior court placed the resident on Krol Status (i.e., the superior court was monitoring his mental health treatment). The operator then recommended to the sergeant that the resident be transported to the hospital for an evaluation. Meanwhile, the resident was making threats and arguing with the two officers. The sergeant informed the operator that the resident’s condition was worsening and that he would transport him to the hospital as recommended. The sergeant then requested backup and an ambulance. The sergeant explained to the resident he was to be taken to a local hospital for evaluation. Initially, the resident refused and stated that he would fight the officers. The two officers continued to talk to the resident and eventually convinced him to comply. At that time, another officer and a member of Ridgewood Emergency Services arrived; they all escorted the resident to the first floor. Before exiting the center, the sergeant told the resident that he needed to search him for hidden weapons. Once again, the resident became very agitated and refused to be transported. The sergeant advised the resident that a weapon search was standard procedure and requested his cooperation. The resident refused to comply, clenching his fist and taking a combative stance. The 42-year-old officer moved in and attempted to grab the resident, who reached into his left pocket and pulled out a folding metal knife with the blade open. When the resident raised the knife into the air, the 33-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, joined the scuffle. Both officers grabbed the resident’s arm as they wrestled to control him. The resident swung the knife at the 33-year-old officer’s head, slicing the officer’s hat. During the struggle, the 33-year-old officer received a puncture wound on his arms/hands, and the 42-year-old officer received a laceration on his arms/hands. The officers pulled the 55-year-old resident to the ground, disarmed him, and placed him in handcuffs. The resident remained combative as he was immobilized and placed on a stretcher. He was taken into custody and transported to a local hospital for an evaluation. The resident had a prior criminal record including police assault, a violent crime, weapons violations, and drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. The resident was charged with Aggravated Assault. Both officers were taken to a local hospital where they were treated and released.

"A corporal with the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), Pittsburgh, was shot and killed following a high- speed traffic pursuit well before dawn on December 12. The 45-year-old corporal began midnight-shift duty for the PSP-Pittsburgh station at 11 p.m. on December 11. About 1:55 the next morning, he contacted the PSP dispatch center to report his pursuit of a vehicle for a traffic violation and to request assistance. After the vehicle crashed onto the curb at a motel entrance, the corporal ordered the two passengers, who had gotten out of the car on the passenger side, to show their hands. He also commanded the driver to move to the trunk area on the driver’s side of the car. The driver reportedly became verbally combative and refused to comply with the command. According to one of the passengers, when the corporal tried to place the driver’s hands on the car, the driver attempted to attack the corporal physically. The corporal then sprayed the suspect with pepper spray, but the suspect grabbed the officer’s arm and hand. During this struggle, the suspect allegedly took the corporal’s service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him multiple times. The victim corporal, who had nearly 24 years of law enforcement experience, suffered wounds to the neck and throat. The fatal bullet entered his chest through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor. The passengers fled the scene on foot before the shooting began but later reported hearing gunshots fired in rapid succession. The suspect left the scene in his own vehicle. Assisting officers discovered the victim corporal at 2:05 a.m. on the ground of the motel parking lot entrance. The emergency lights of his marked PSP vehicle were still flashing, and the driver’s door was open. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 2:26 a.m. Later that day, with the help of a confidential informant, officers were able to locate the suspect driver and the two passengers. One of the passengers reported receiving a cell phone call from the suspect, who allegedly referred to the shooting during the call. The suspect reportedly placed a second call requesting that the passenger return to the scene and retrieve a Glock handgun. The passenger refused to do so. The passenger reported that he had observed the suspect attempting to conceal the Glock under the driver’s seat prior to encountering the corporal. Members of a PSP forensic services unit subsequently found the fully loaded Glock in shrubbery near the motel parking lot.

"On May 2, a 56-year-old captain with the Wartburg Police Department died from injuries he received while attempting an arrest on April 23. At 12:17 a.m. on the day of the incident, the captain, a 23-year veteran of law enforcement, and another officer were dispatched to a domestic violence call at an apartment. Because the subject had a history of evading arrest and a court order to stay away from the area, the captain went to the back window of the apartment, and the other officer went to the front door. Although the woman who came to the front door refused to unlock it and stated that the suspect was not there, the officer could see the suspect, who ran to the back of the apartment. When the woman finally unlocked the door, the officer entered the residence. As the officer was halfway through, he heard the captain yelling, so he ran out the front door and went to the back of the apartment. The victim captain was at his patrol unit holding his left arm and appeared to have a dislocated shoulder. He stated that a struggle had ensued with the suspect during which the suspect hit him several times and knocked him down before fleeing towards the end of the apartment complex.

"A 28-year-old patrol officer with the Caruthersville Police Department was killed at 12:36 a.m. on August 16 during a felony traffic pursuit/stop. At 12:33 a.m., deputies with the Pemiscot County Sheriff’s Department began to pursue an individual who had attempted to set his stepfather and his stepfather’s house on fire before fleeing in his stepfather’s vehicle. To assist the deputies, the patrol officer, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience, and another officer deployed a tire-deflation device as part of a roadblock. One officer was sitting in his patrol car in the westbound lane; the 28-year-old officer was in his patrol car in the eastbound lane.

"On February 6, a former deputy sheriff with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office died of injuries he received in an unprovoked attack on December 10, 1994, in Rowland Heights. The then 29-year-old veteran deputy, who had 7 years of law enforcement experience, made a felony traffic stop shortly before 6 p.m. and was in the process of handcuffing and placing the subject in his patrol vehicle, when a man on a skateboard approached from behind. As he neared the deputy, the skateboarder pulled out a .357-caliber revolver and held it to the back of the deputy’s head and ordered the deputy to release the arrestee. The skateboarder then shot the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the back of the head. The arrestee exited the patrol vehicle and fled the scene in his own vehicle with the skateboarder. The 20-year-old alleged shooter, who had prior arrests for a drug law violation and was a known user of controlled substances, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a nearby town. The arrestee turned himself in to the Corona Police Department. He later pleaded guilty to the felony charge of Assault on a Peace Officer and received a 14-year prison term. The deputy sustained significant brain injuries, which led to his death in 2018 at the age of 53. ",138
"At 5:30 p.m. on November 6, a 41-year-old sergeant and a 39-year-old deputy sheriff with the Peach County Sheriff’s Office were fatally wounded while answering a disturbance call in Byron. The sergeant was a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 17 years of experience; and the deputy was a veteran with 13 years of law enforcement experience. The officers first spoke with the residents who had called 911 and had reported their neighbor threatened them with a firearm while they were riding their 4-wheeler. The sergeant and deputy then went to the neighbor’s residence and spoke with him. After a brief conversation, the sergeant advised the man he was under arrest. The man pulled a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from under the right side of his shirt and shot the sergeant and the deputy at close range. Both officers were wearing body armor at the time of the incident. The sergeant was fatally wounded in the front of the head and the deputy was wounded in the front lower torso/stomach, in the front below the waist, and fatally in the front of his head. The original complainant heard gunshots from the neighboring residence and again called 911. Three Byron Police Department (BPD) units responded and the suspect fired a rifle at them. The BPD officers returned fire and the suspect was struck and apprehended. The victim sergeant succumbed to his injuries that day, and the victim deputy died on November 8. The 57-year-old suspect was charged with two counts of Murder and three counts of Aggravated Assault. He had a prior criminal record including a violent crime.",702

"A Chattanooga police officer with nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience was shot and killed with her service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, after struggling with a college student who had fled an area hospital while awaiting a mental evaluation. The 26-year-old officer was wearing body armor when she was shot seven times at close range in the front of the head, the front upper torso, arms, and fatally in the rear of the head. The incident occurred shortly before 1:30 p.m. on May 6. Earlier that day, another Chattanooga police officer had transported the male student to the hospital for a mental evaluation after school officials reported that the student was a danger to himself or others. While awaiting evaluation, the student escaped from the examination room, and the officer who had trans- ported him to the hospital began chasing him. The officer requested assistance. Responding to the request, the victim officer notified the police dispatcher that she had the suspect in sight and that he was running. A few seconds later, the victim officer radioed the dispatcher that she was struggling with the suspect, and about 20 seconds after that, the officer said the suspect was trying to get her gun. Additional responding officers arrived at the scene to find the suspect was standing over the victim officer, who was lying on the ground. The 20-year- old male attempted to elude the responding officers but was taken into custody less than a block from the scene. After the shooting, the suspect had apparently thrown the victim officer’s weapon into a drainage culvert, but other officers later recovered it during the crime scene investigation. The man, who was apparently under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder.",491
"A 29-year-old patrol officer with the Flint Township Police Department was shot while investigating suspicious persons and circumstances near a local hotel around 10:30 p.m. on January 23. The officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience at the time, was sitting in his marked patrol vehicle when he noticed two men in a van pull into a hotel across the street. He ran the van’s license plate number and learned that the van was registered to a man who had three outstanding arrest warrants. The officer drove into the hotel’s parking lot and saw the van was now backed up to the door of a hotel room, and the two individuals were unloading items from the van into the room. The officer parked his vehicle, got out, and approached the driver. He asked the man if he was the owner of the van; the man said he was. The officer told the man that he was under arrest, and he attempted to take him into custody. However, the man resisted and pulled away from the officer, who sent out a call for backup via his portable police radio. As the two struggled, the officer’s right arm became tangled with the subject’s left arm. Then, the officer, who was wearing body armor, heard two gunshots and felt a burning sensation in his left arm and the left side of his chest. Realizing he had been shot, the officer disengaged from the subject, took cover in an adjacent lot, and notified responding officers that he had been shot. The suspect, armed with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, approached the open door of the van and fired additional rounds at the officer but missed. The suspect then got into the van and drove through the parking lot. At the same time, officers from the Swartz Creek Police Department (SCPD) arrived at the scene. The first SCPD officer pulled his vehicle into the parking lot and drove through a snow bank to position himself behind the van. The second SCPD officer stopped his vehicle behind the first SCPD officer’s car. The suspect stopped the van, put it in reverse, and rammed the first SCPD officer’s vehicle. Then, the suspect exited the van and fired at the first SCPD officer who was still seated in his car. The first SCPD officer returned fire, striking the man several times. The second SCPD officer exited his vehicle and sought cover behind it as the suspect started shooting at him. After being shot, the offender eventually fell to the ground, and officers arrested him. The 55-year-old man was taken to a local hospital for treatment. He was charged with two counts of Assault with Intent to Murder, Carrying a Concealed Weapon, Possession of a Weapon by a Felon, Assaulting/Resisting/Obstructing a Law Enforcement Officer—Causing Serious Bodily Injury, and Attempting to Kill a K-9. The victim patrol officer was also taken to a local hospital for treatment to his wounds, including the one to his chest that had been covered by the officer’s protective vest. The wounded officer has since returned to duty.",263
"Shortly before 3 p.m. on November 4, a 41-year-old sergeant with the New York Police Department was shot and fatally wounded, and a 30-year-old sergeant was shot and injured during a traffic pursuit and stop. Earlier in the day, around 11:20 a.m., a man forced his way into his estranged wife’s apartment, displayed a firearm, and attempted to forcibly remove their 3-year-old son from the residence. A resident of the home attempted to calm the man for approximately 3 hours before convincing him to leave the premises without the child. Once the man was gone, the woman called 911 and reported the incident. The 41-year-old sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 19 years of experience, and another officer began searching for the suspect’s vehicle using details provided by dispatchers. The sergeant and the officer, in a marked police vehicle, spotted the suspect’s vehicle and followed it. The sergeant provided their location to dispatch, allowing other police units to converge on the area. The suspect attempted to evade the pursuing officers by turning onto a succession of streets, but responding officers eventually blocked the suspect’s path with their police vehicles. To avoid the blockade, the suspect attempted a U-turn. However, another police vehicle collided with the rear of the suspect’s vehicle, causing him to lose control and strike a parked dump truck. With the suspect’s vehicle trapped between the dump truck and a police vehicle, responding officers attempted to take him into custody. The sergeant and the officer exited their police vehicle and, along with other officers, approached the suspect’s vehicle. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, approached the driver’s side of the suspect’s vehicle with his service weapon drawn. Without warning, the suspect shot the sergeant in the left side of the head at close range with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The suspect fired two more rounds and struck the 30-year-old sergeant, who was also wearing body armor, once in the front below his waist. The 30-year-old sergeant, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 9 years of experience, sustained a graze wound to his left leg. Other officers returned fire, justifiably killing the suspect. With the suspect down, officers requested emergency medical services for the injured officers. Both sergeants were transported to a local hospital where the 41-year-old sergeant succumbed to his wound. The other sergeant was treated for the injury to his leg and released. The 35-year-old suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. He had a prior criminal record which included a drug law violation and an assaulting an officer/resisting arrest charge. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured sergeant had not returned to duty.",183
"A deputy with the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Department was shot on October 19 at 4:15 p.m. while responding to a domestic disturbance call in Green Lake. When the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Department received a 911 call from a woman whose husband allegedly had hit her and taken their infant hostage in their apartment, the Department dispatched a patrol car to the scene. While the woman remained on the telephone with the dispatcher, the man went into the bedroom where he had several firearms. The woman then was able to take the infant and her daughter from the living room. She exited the apartment building and went to her car. At that time, the patrol car with two deputies arrived at the scene; shortly thereafter, another deputy, who was 38 years old and had over 14 years’ law enforcement experience, arrived. The deputies conferred briefly and decided that the deputies who were first to arrive would establish a roadblock farther down the street. The remaining deputy, who was wearing body armor, opened his trunk and began to remove his tactical rifle. Undetected, the suspect went out onto the apartment’s second-floor balcony and shot the deputy with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle in the chest and fatally above his protective vest in the neck and the throat. Witnessing the shooting, the woman and her children fled to safety at a nearby apartment building where she called 911 and reported an officer down. The suspect then yelled threats toward the street and fired two additional shots at a man who had stopped and exited his vehicle to assist the victim officer; the man abandoned his vehicle and fled the scene on foot. The deputies at the roadblock radioed the victim deputy and received no response. Shortly thereafter, the dispatcher requested additional assistance because an officer was down. The suspect reentered the apartment, fired at least ten additional rounds into the interior entry door and wall of the apartment, and entered the bedroom, firing more shots. After receiving notification that there was an officer down, one of the deputies who had established the roadblock worked his way to the scene and approached the area where the victim deputy lay, ordering citizens into their houses. The deputy dragged the victim deputy to safety on the driver’s side of the squad car and attempted to resuscitate him. At that time, the suspect shot at the assisting deputy from the bedroom window. The deputy returned fire across the hood of the car toward an apartment window in which the glass had been broken and the blinds were moving. When the shooting stopped, the deputy attempted to drag the victim deputy from the scene; two additional officers responding to the incident assisted in putting the victim deputy in the squad car. The victim deputy was transported to a local fire department, then to a medical center where he was pronounced dead at 6:30 p.m. Shortly after firing shots from the bedroom, the 21-year-old suspect, who had no known prior arrests, used a 9 mm pistol to shoot himself in the head. Because officials thought the suspect had barricaded himself in the apartment, they evacuated local residents. After several hours, SWAT teams from the Winnebago County Sheriff’s Department and the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Department entered the apartment and found the suspect dead.",517
"On May 11 at 7:18 a.m., a 46-year-old lieutenant with the Yell County Sheriff’s Department was shot and killed with his service weapon while responding to a domestic disturbance call in Dardenelle. At 6:48 a.m., a woman called Yell County 911’s nonemergency line to report that her daughter’s boyfriend had come to their residence and threatened to kill them. The individual, who was known to law enforcement for several previous domestic violence calls, had punched the woman’s daughter and granddaughter. The woman scared the man away by firing shots into the ground and reported to dispatch that she did not think he was armed. Around the same time, a neighbor also called 911 to report the disturbance and provided a description of the truck the man was driving. The lieutenant located the suspect’s truck and conducted a traffic stop. At 7:18 a.m., a passing motorist called dispatchers to report an officer down at the location of the traffic stop. Another officer responded to the scene where he found the lieutenant critically wounded by rounds from his own service weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. One round had struck the front of the lieutenant’s head and his neck/throat. A second round had penetrated his body armor and struck his front upper torso/chest. The lieutenant was transported to a hospital where he succumbed to his chest wound. At 7:43 a.m., the same neighbor called to report she thought more people had been injured at her neighbor’s residence and that the suspect had wrecked his truck nearby and had run toward the residence. A number of officers converged on the residence where they found two female victims had been shot and killed. The original caller had died in front of her residence, and a young female had died on the front porch. The officers heard voices from inside the residence and ordered the suspect to come out. A female responded that she was wounded and being held hostage. The suspect demanded a pizza, a million dollars, and a helicopter. The suspect called 911, and an officer began negotiating with him via telephone. The Arkansas State Police SWAT unit arrived and took over the negotiations with the suspect, who eventually surrendered at 2:35 p.m. The 42-year-old suspect was charged with three counts of Capital Murder.",157
"A corporal and a patrol officer with the Brookhaven Police Department were shot and killed while conducting an investigative activity around 4:50 a.m. on September 29. Following a report of shots fired at a residence, the 31-year-old veteran corporal, who had 7 years of law enforcement experience, and the 35-year-old veteran patrol officer, who had 8 years of law enforcement experience, simultaneously arrived at the scene shortly before 4:50 a.m. They located a vehicle with bullet-hole damage near a residence.

"On June 4, a patrol officer with the Springfield Police Department (SPD) was killed after responding to a domestic call just after 1 p.m. The 55-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 36 years of law enforcement experience, was dispatched to an apartment to escort a woman’s boyfriend to remove his belongings from her residence. Earlier that day, the woman had obtained a restraining order against her boyfriend. The officer, the woman and her young child, her aunt, and the boyfriend went down a hallway and climbed stairs to the top floor where the woman lived. As the woman opened her door, the boyfriend forced the woman inside and quickly closed the door, leaving the officer and the aunt in the hallway. The officer tried to force the door open, and he and the aunt heard the woman pleading with her boyfriend and then heard a gunshot. The aunt ran from the top floor, and as she fled, she heard more gunshots and a scuffle. The aunt hid in an alcove at the bottom of the stairwell and asked a tenant in a nearby apartment to call the police. The aunt then heard someone come down the stairs and leave the building. A witness saw a man walk from the building to a vehicle while holding or concealing something to the front of his pants. Calls were made to 911, and responding law enforcement officers found the victim officer on the top floor landing with several gunshot wounds. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, had been shot with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at close range in his arms/hands, front upper torso/chest, and fatally in the front of his head. Officers found the woman inside the apartment with a gunshot wound to the face. Both victims were taken to a local hospital where the officer was pronounced dead at 1:31 p.m. The woman underwent surgery and was in stable condition after the incident. The aunt provided information to law enforcement officers about the suspect, who was in his mid-30s, and about the suspect’s vehicle.

"A corporal with the Detroit Police Department (DPD) was killed and a DPD police officer was injured while responding to a home invasion in progress around 7 p.m. on November 20. Upon arriving at the scene, the 46-year-old corporal and the 32-year-old police officer parked one house north of the residence being invaded and met with two women from the residence outside on the street. When the women told the officer that the intruder had a large firearm, they notified dispatch to advise other officers in the area. Because there were no lights on inside the residence except for in the basement, the officers checked the windows with their flashlights and saw no movement. However, when the corporal walked down the driveway to check the side of the house, he heard footsteps, so he retreated and called for backup. Once a couple of backup units arrived, officers unlocked the front door with keys provided by the homeowners and announced themselves, receiving no response. The officers entered the door, split up into smaller groups, and began clearing the residence. Other officers stayed outside to cover the basement door and the front entrance. The first officers to respond—the corporal who had 16 years of law enforcement experience and the police officer who had 3 years of law enforcement experience—led three other officers downstairs toward the basement. The corporal announced their presence and shouted multiple verbal commands. Before the officers reached the bottom of the stairs, a gunshot rang out and the veteran corporal fell to the ground. Officers could not determine where the shot came from. After a brief pause, the offender fired more rounds. The other four officers sought cover by running up the stairs and out of the residence. As the last officer made it to the top of the steps, he was struck with a round in his rear legs. The 32-year-old victim officer ran outside and collapsed in front of one of the patrol units. Another officer dragged him behind the vehicle as the offender, who had apparently run up the steps and out a side door, fired several more rounds, then fled into a nearby alley. Meanwhile, two officers taking cover with the victim officer attempted first aid, loaded the injured officer into a patrol unit and transported him to a hospital where he was treated and expected to recover. At the residence, officers called for backup, and within minutes more than 40 DPD officers swarmed the area, some to assist at the residence and others to canvass the neighborhood for the offender and to direct traffic from the congested area. Officers found a rifle that the offender had dropped and a trail of blood. One of the women advised an officer that she was the offender’s girlfriend, told him of a recent domestic situation with the offender, and showed the officer a picture of him on her cell phone. As some officers began clearing the residence again, one officer entered the side door with his weapon drawn. He immediately saw the victim corporal lying at the bottom of the basement stairs and radioed for emergency medical services. Officers carried the victim corporal outside to one of the patrol units and transported him to the hospital. Shortly after their arrival, the victim corporal died from the fatal gunshot wound received in his neck/throat, above his body armor. As officers continued to canvass the neighborhood, they saw a handprint on a garage door a few streets away and radioed for backup. Other officers noticed someone lying under bushes in front of a residence near the garage. When they ordered the individual to show his hands, there was no response. One of the officers grabbed the individual’s legs and pulled him out. The officer immediately recognized the individual as the offender from the photo previously provided and observed a large gunshot wound on his right forearm with the bone exposed. One officer called for medical personnel and another officer tried to stop the bleeding. Officers secured the offender with handcuffs before medics transported him to the hospital. The 28-year-old offender, who has a criminal history that includes a weapons violation, had been recently released from parole. He was arrested and charged with Murder/Non-Negligent Manslaughter (Voluntary) and Aggravated/Felonious Assault.",499
"A 50-year-old detective with the San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) was shot and killed in an ambush (entrapment and premeditation) in front of police headquarters around 11:45 a.m. on November 20. Moments prior to the incident, the detective, a veteran of law enforcement who had nearly 21 years of experience, had stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation on the street in front of the police department.

"On October 24, a 47-year-old deputy sheriff with the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (Sacramento County SD) was killed while investigating suspicious persons. A few hours later that same day, a 42-year-old detective with the Placer County Sheriff’s Office (Placer County SO) was killed, and a Placer County SO deputy sheriff was injured as a result of a traffic pursuit involving the same offender. About 10:30 a.m., the Sacramento County SD deputy and his partner were investigating a suspicious vehicle parked behind a hotel in Sacramento.

The deputy, a 15-year veteran of law enforcement, walked to the driver’s side of the car to make contact with a man sitting in the driver’s seat, and his partner walked toward the woman. The deputy was less than 10 feet from the car when the driver produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired at him. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The male suspect also fired at the deputy’s partner as he and his accomplice fled in the car. They later abandoned the car, and the male suspect attempted to carjack a vehicle. When the driver of that vehicle refused to exit, the male suspect shot the driver in the face multiple times. He then went to another vehicle, confronted its driver, and took her car at gunpoint. The two suspects drove to another area of the county, where they abandoned the woman’s car. The male suspect then confronted another motorist and took his truck at gunpoint. The pair left the area in the truck and drove to Auburn in Placer County. Multiple Placer County SO patrol units responded to the area. Around 12:30 p.m., the male suspect fired at deputies, abandoned the truck and his female accomplice, and stole a Placer County SO patrol unit. As the suspect drove away, three Placer County SO detectives (one in a lead vehicle and two in a vehicle following behind) approached the scene. The detectives were unaware that the male suspect had stolen the Placer County SO patrol unit, so when they passed the stolen patrol unit heading the opposite direction, they turned their vehicles around and followed it. When the detectives arrived at the end of the road, they saw the patrol unit they had followed parked in a driveway. The detective in the lead vehicle parked about 40 feet from the driveway.

"A 23-year-old trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), Huntingdon Station, was shot and killed while conducting investigative activity around 6:20 p.m. on December 30. In response to a woman’s complaint that her ex-boyfriend had violated a Protection From Abuse (PFA) court order, the trooper, who had 1 year of law enforcement experience, went to the man’s residence to question him.

The man went to his bedroom, and the trooper met him in the hallway as he came out. They proceeded to exit the residence, first the trooper and then the man, with the man’s mother following behind. As they exited, the man’s mother saw her son pull a weapon from his waistband area, and she yelled at him. The trooper turned, and the subject shot the trooper in the head with a .32-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The victim trooper was fatally wounded in both the front and rear of his head. The subject’s mother then fled the scene with her boyfriend, who had been in the basement and reported the shooting. The subject later fled the scene on foot before authorities could apprehend him. Around 9:45 a.m. the next day, as members of the PSP Special Emergency Response Team were clearing the crime scene, members of the PSP Troop G worked to clear nearby structures and found the subject hiding in an unoccupied camper approximately ¼ mile from the scene. Upon making verbal contact with the suspect, troopers could not get him to comply with their commands. When the suspect made a move to come out of the camper toward the troopers with a firearm in his right hand, he was justifiably killed. The 32-year-old offender, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record which included a violent crime.",3
"Just before 6 a.m. on September 1, a 32-year-old sergeant with the Draper City Police Department was fatally wounded during an ambush. The sergeant, a veteran with nearly 10 years of law enforcement experience, was returning to the police station to turn in paperwork at the end of his shift when he noticed a disabled vehicle parked at an odd angle. The sergeant stopped his marked patrol vehicle to offer assistance. When he rolled down the window to speak with a male subject, the man produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shot the sergeant. The round entered the armhole of the sergeant’s body armor and struck him fatally in the front upper torso/chest. The victim sergeant accelerated his patrol vehicle while the suspect continued to fire at him, shooting out the sergeant’s back window. Before the sergeant lost control of the vehicle, hit a nearby tree, and lost consciousness, he was able to use the radio to call out, “Shots fired!” The suspect also allegedly shot his female companion. The 35- year-old suspect had a criminal record including arrests for drug violations. He was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident. He was charged with Aggravated Murder, Attempted Aggravated Murder, and Discharge of Weapon by Restricted Person.",766
"A police officer with the Glendale Police Department was shot and killed while assisting another officer with a vehicle stop on February 19. Around 7:30 a.m., the 24-year-old police officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience, responded to back up the primary officer, who had stopped a car with no license plate. After detaining the driver in the back seat of his patrol car for a misdemeanor warrant, the primary officer approached the car again near the passenger door while the backup officer covered from the rear of the vehicle. Without notice, the front seat passenger exited the car and spun around to face the officer at the rear of the vehicle. As he did so, he drew a .357 Magnum revolver from his waistband and immediately fired at the backup officer, who was wearing body armor, and fatally hit the officer in the right side of his head. The primary officer fired at the suspect and then radioed dispatch. The assailant quickly moved away from the scene while shooting at the primary officer. As the primary officer went for cover, he fired again and hit the suspect in the right knee, instantly knocking him to the ground. The primary officer continued to watch the suspect and attempted to protect the victim officer by moving him to the closest point of cover behind the wheel of a parked car. The 33-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including police assault and weapons violations, was located that day by responding officers from both the Glendale and Phoenix Police Departments. He abruptly surrendered and was charged with First-Degree Murder and Attempted First-Degree Murder.",542

"On June 6 around 7 a.m., a 27-year-old patrol deputy with the Dickson County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed in an unprovoked attack as he was on patrol and stopped at the scene of a vehicle crash. The deputy, with almost 6 years of law enforcement experience, was driving his patrol vehicle when the driver of a truck that had pulled in behind him at an intersection accelerated into oncoming traffic and passed the marked patrol vehicle. The driver of the truck pulled alongside the vehicle in front of the deputy and turned sharply into the vehicle, forcing it to the curb. The veteran deputy, who was wearing body armor, pulled his patrol vehicle over between the two vehicles, activated his lights, and began to report the accident over his radio. His report stopped in midsentence as the driver of the truck exited his vehicle and began shooting a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun at the deputy as he sat in his patrol vehicle. The shooter fired a total of 11 rounds, striking the deputy in the front of the head, as well as the hood and windshield of the deputy’s vehicle and a nearby house. Before suffering the fatal wound, the deputy drew his weapon, and fired one round at the suspect but missed. It was subsequently learned that the shooter was the estranged husband of the woman driving the other vehicle, and that she had a restraining order against him. After shooting the deputy, the man walked to the car in which the woman was now cowering on the floor, and he began shouting at her to look at him. The 27-year-old shooter, who had a prior criminal record of violent crime, then committed suicide with a single shot to the head. The woman called 911 as a nearby witness to the crime tried to render aid to the deputy. Backup officers and emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene. The deputy was transported to a local medical center where he died from his wound the next day.",1188
"At 10:37 p.m. on June 23, a deputy sheriff with the Comal County Sheriff’s Office was shot while handling a person with a mental illness in Bulverde. The deputy, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a residence where a man reportedly had a firearm and was suicidal. The caller was a family member and said he believed the man intended to attempt “suicide by cop.” When the 35-year-old deputy, along with three officers from the Bulverde Police Department (BPD), pulled up to the residence, they saw a man walking around with a firearm in his hand. The deputy and officers drew their weapons and ordered the man several times to put down the weapon, telling him they were there to help.

"A 48-year-old police officer with the Texas Tech Police Department (TTPD) was shot and killed around 7:45 p.m. on October 9 at the university’s police station while he was processing an individual suspected of firing a weapon in a dormitory. Earlier in the day, around 3:30 p.m., the officer, who had 5 months of law enforcement experience, arrived at a Texas Tech University (TTU) dormitory suite with another officer to investigate a reported odor of marijuana. The officers knocked on the suite door; however, no one answered, so they left. Approximately 2 hours later, the officer and a different backup officer went to the student union building and met with two TTU students, who lived in the same suite the officers had been to earlier. The students reported one of their suitemates had discharged a firearm inside his dorm room around 2 a.m. that morning. The officers returned to the dormitory suite to conduct a welfare check shortly before 6 p.m. They entered the dorm room and saw evidence of drug use and a pellet pistol in plain view, but the student who lived in the room was not there. The officers were collecting the items in plain sight when the student returned. Based on the visible evidence in the room, the officers searched the student, handcuffed him, and transported him to the TTU police station. In the briefing room, the officer was completing the paperwork required to transport the student to the Lubbock County Jail. The student requested to use the restroom, and the officer removed the handcuffs. The student attempted to enter a private restroom stall but was not allowed to do so. The student was escorted back to the briefing room and sat back down next to the officer, who was wearing body armor. Without warning, the student produced a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun from his pants and fired one round, mortally wounding the officer in the right side of his head.

"Around 8:30 p.m. on August 30, a 28-year-old corporal with the West Columbia Police Department (WCPD) was wounded while answering a call for backup. A short time earlier, a WCPD officer responded to a report of an impaired man in a vehicle. The officer parked his patrol unit next to the man’s vehicle and approached the driver’s side door. The subject placed his vehicle in reverse, and the vehicle rolled backwards onto an adjacent street. The officer took hold of the side mirror and stopped the rolling vehicle. The subject was fidgeting and yelling, so the officer asked him what was wrong. The man ignored the officer and continued his erratic behavior. The officer asked the man to exit the vehicle, but the subject did not comply and stated he needed to make a phone call because he was out of gas. Tinted windows prevented the officer from seeing clearly inside the vehicle, so he called for backup. The corporal, who had nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, and two additional WCPD officers arrived at the scene. When one of the newly arrived officers opened the driver’s door of the vehicle, the man grabbed a 4-inch knife and held it to his own throat. The man stated that he had been released from prison recently, and he was concerned the officers were going to take him back to jail. The subject repeated that he wanted to make a call, so one of the officers offered to make the call if the man would put down the knife. Once again, the subject ignored the officer and continued to rant and complain. A WCPD sergeant arrived at the scene and asked the man what was wrong; he replied that the officers were trying to take him back to jail. During their conversation, the subject placed the knife on the vehicle seat. While distracting the man by talking to him, the sergeant passed his electronic control device behind his back to one of the other officers. At that point, the sergeant and two of the officers reached inside the vehicle and attempted to pull the man out. The subject pulled away, regained the knife, and started swinging it at the officers as he shouted, “Shoot me!” During the scuffle, the corporal, who was wearing body armor, sustained a cut on his left arm/hand near his palm. The suspect closed the vehicle door, so one of the officers used a baton to break the window. The sergeant ordered the suspect to drop the knife; the suspect tossed it out of the window onto the ground. The sergeant then ordered the suspect to exit the vehicle with his hands visible and to get on the ground. Again, the suspect complied. The officers detained the suspect without further incident and took him into custody. The 40-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had prior arrests that included a weapons violation and a violent crime. He was arrested and charged with Public Disorderly Conduct, Unlawful Weapon, and Assault on a Police Officer While Resisting Arrest. The corporal has since recovered from his injury and returned to duty.",1142

"At 10:15 a.m. on November 22, a 47-year-old deputy sheriff was killed and a 33-year-old deputy sheriff was injured in an ambush in Tallahassee. Both deputies, who were with the Leon County Sheriff’s Office, arrived at the scene of a house fire about the same time. The 47-year-old deputy, a law enforcement veteran with more than 18 years’ experience, exited his vehicle, began walking toward the fire, and was immediately ambushed by gunfire. The man who lived at the burning residence shot the veteran deputy with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, fatally striking the front and side of the deputy’s head. The veteran deputy, who was wearing body armor, died at the scene of the incident. The assailant also fired on the 33-year-old deputy, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience. Firefighters began arriving on scene and took cover while the surviving deputy exchanged gunfire with the assailant. In the meantime, an off-duty police officer with the Tallahassee Police Department (Tallahassee PD) was in his home when he heard the gunfire. The officer secured his family in place and left to investigate. By the time the officer arrived at the fire, the surviving deputy had taken cover after being shot in the rear upper torso/back (the round struck the deputy’s protective vest). The officer and the deputy looked for the assailant as they moved to another position of cover. About that time, another Tallahassee PD officer who arrived attempted to render aid to the fallen veteran deputy, but he advised over the radio that the deputy was deceased. The assailant fired on that officer, and the officer used his patrol unit as cover. The first Tallahassee PD officer, the one who arrived on the scene from his home, was then able to locate, shoot, and justifiably kill the 53-year-old assailant. The assailant, who had a prior criminal record and was under the influence of narcotics, fired 28 rounds during the incident.

The officer, who had nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, was completing paperwork when, according to witnesses as well as a security camera on-site, a vehicle pulled along the passenger side of the officer’s patrol car. The driver then lowered his window and shot the victim officer, who was wearing body armor, in the rear of the head with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. The shooter then exited his vehicle, opened the patrol car door, and took the victim officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic duty pistol. The man returned to his car and drove away from the scene.

"Around midnight on a winter night in the West, a law enforcement officer, who had 27 years of experience, assisted another officer with a traffic stop. The second officer arrested the driver of the vehicle for DUI and transported  him in a police unit for processing. The assisting officer stayed on scene to oversee the impounding of the subject's vehicle. A tow truck arrived, and the operator began prepping the offender's vehicle for towing. About this time, the officer observed a male subject walking down the sidewalk in their direction. The subject approached the  tow truck driver and began questioning him about the vehicle being towed. When the officer heard the subject's heated questions, he exited his patrol vehicle, approached the man, and asked him if he could help with anything. The man replied in a loud, aggressive tone as he walked out of sight. The officer began filling out an impound form, which included an inventory of the vehicle's contents. The tow truck driver acted as a witness for the contents.  As the officer and tow truck driver were involved in the inventory process, the man returned, approached them from behind, and shot the officer in the back of the head with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The officer took cover around the other side of the tow truck as the offender attempted to flee. The unarmed tow truck driver began chasing the offender down the street. The offender shot at the driver, so the driver stopped and hurried back to the officer to tell him that the offender was returning. The officer maintained a position of cover and fired two rounds at the offender with his .40 caliber semiautomatic handgun. Although the rounds did not strike the offender, they caused him to flee. An assisting officer arrived on scene and transported the victim officer in a patrol car to the hospital. The officer was treated and released from the hospital after 4 days with additional medical care to follow. Two days later, an extensive investigation and search for the 49-year-old offender ended successfully. The offender was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison.",1244

"At 1:45 a.m. on March 19, a supervisor with the First Judicial District (FJD) of Pennsylvania was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a man in Philadelphia. The 53-year-old supervisor with 8½ years of law enforcement experience, an FJD investigator, and two officers with the FBI’s Philadelphia Violent Crimes/Fugitive Task Force went to the apartment of a man wanted on Rape and Drug Violations. The task force officers requested assistance from the Philadelphia Police Department, which sent two officers to the scene who covered the alley behind the apartment. One of the task force officers knocked on the apartment’s front door and indicated their identities to the occupants. Several seconds later, a woman inside the apartment opened the door and told the officers that the man they were looking for was in the bedroom. The officers entered the poorly lit apartment, and as the woman stepped into the kitchen, the man opened fire on the officers with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. One of the bullets struck the supervisor in the stomach below his protective vest, and he fell to the floor. Despite his injury, the supervisor was able to fire 15 shots, but apparently none of those shots hit the offender. As they backed out of the apartment along with the other task force officer, the investigator was shot in the stomach and one of the task force officers was struck in the left hand. The officers then heard two shots from inside the apartment. The task force officers attempted to come to the aid of the supervisor, but when they tried to reenter the apartment, the suspect opened fire on them again. They returned fire and shot the suspect in his back and leg. One of the officers called for backup from the Philadelphia Police Department and numerous officers, including the officers who had been covering the rear of the apartment building, swarmed to the front of the building. The suspect climbed out of a rear window in the apartment and broke into the apartment directly below. The responding officers searched the man’s apartment, but failed to find him.

The two deputies went to the home of the man’s father, which had an auto junkyard behind it and was located in a heavily wooded area, in an attempt to locate the subject. The deputies knocked on the front door of the residence, but no one answered. They then went around the house to the junkyard. The man, who had prior arrests that include Assault on a Police Officer and Weapons Violations, is believed to have hidden among the cars and fired 3 shots from a .38- caliber handgun at the deputies.

"On January 22 at 8:50 a.m., a 28-year-old deputy sheriff and a 38-year-old sergeant with the Del Norte County Sheriff’s Office (DNCSO) were stabbed and injured while answering a disturbance call in Crescent City. A woman called dispatch and reported her roommate was in her room yelling at her. The deputy sheriff, who had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the residence and was met at the front door by the roommate, who let the deputy in. Once inside, the deputy turned on his body camera and then spoke with both roommates about the dispute. The man was primarily upset that the woman had turned off the internet service. The woman wanted the man to move out of the residence. After hearing both accounts, the deputy determined the matter was civil in nature and not criminal, but he tried to offer a resolution by suggesting the man leave the residence for a while. The deputy offered the man a ride, but the man did not want to leave without his cats. He tried to call a friend to come get him, but the friend did not answer the phone. The man told the deputy he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and repeatedly said that he would hurt his roommate if he remained there. Based on these recurring statements, the deputy determined the man should be placed in protective custody. The deputy asked if he would speak to mental health workers, and the man declined. During their interactions, the deputy saw what he thought was a rifle inside the residence and a sheathed knife on the man. Around 9:20 a.m., the deputy radioed for backup using a code indicating weapons were present. When the sergeant, an 11-year veteran of law enforcement, arrived at the residence at 9:29 a.m., the deputy had the man step outside. As the sergeant, who was also wearing a body camera, approached, the deputy reiterated the statements the man had told him so the sergeant could ascertain the seriousness of the situation. The deputy asked the man about the rifle and knife he observed in the residence; the man said it was a pellet gun and admitted he had a knife. The deputy told the man they were going to take him into custody for a mental health evaluation and began to move near him. The subject began yelling repeatedly that he did not want to deal with “mental health in this county.” The officers ordered him not to reach for anything and repeatedly told him to put his hands behind his head; however, he refused to comply. As the officers talked to the subject in an attempt to calm him, the subject said that someone was coming to pick him up and that he would leave his roommate alone. The subject then advised the officers he was going to reach for his phone. The sergeant warned the subject that reaching for anything would result in a firearm being pointed at him. The sergeant again implored the subject to place his hands on the back of his head. The subject then put his hand on his knife, so the deputy pointed his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun toward the man and notified dispatch “one at gunpoint.” The officers continued to command the subject to put his hands on his head, and at one point the subject replied, “No! You’re going to have to shoot.” Around 9:34 a.m., the sergeant moved toward the subject in an effort to subdue him; the subject pulled his knife from its sheath. The deputy called dispatch again for backup. The sergeant attempted to control the subject’s hands, but he maneuvered the knife and stabbed the sergeant on the top of both hands and wrists. The sergeant lost his grip, and the deputy then engaged in a physical confrontation with the subject, attempting to pull him down. As the officers tried to gain control of the subject, he turned and stabbed the sergeant in the left side of his back. The blade penetrated the sergeant’s uniform and partially penetrated his ballistic vest; the body armor prevented the blade from piercing the sergeant’s skin. The subject turned and attacked the deputy with the knife, resulting in a 6-inch cut on the left side of the deputy’s head. The subject fell to the ground but got back up and rushed several feet toward the deputy, who attempted to pull his weapon and stand up before the subject reached him. The subject tried to stab the deputy in his lower left chest; however, the deputy backed up and the subject cut the deputy’s shirt cuff. The subject again turned toward the sergeant, who had drawn his duty weapon and was attempting to get to his feet as the subject raised the knife above his head. The subject was almost on top of the sergeant when the sergeant fired his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded subject fell to the ground. The sergeant also fell to the ground. The deputy, who was approximately 10 feet from the subject, noticed the subject was trying to get up, so he fired three rounds from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, further incapacitating the subject. At 9:35 a.m., the sergeant told dispatchers that shots were fired, an officer was down, and medical attention was needed. The sergeant and deputy ordered the subject, who had risen to his hands and knees, to stay down, but he continued to disregard commands. The subject laid down, but continued roll around. The deputy readied his electronic control device and retrieved the knife from the ground near the subject’s feet. At about 9:38 a.m., law enforcement officers began arriving on scene. A police officer with the Crescent City Police Department placed the subject in handcuffs. Ambulance crews arrived and began treating the deputy and the subject, who were both taken to a local hospital by ambulance. The sergeant was taken to a local hospital by DNCSO deputies. The deputy received 10 staples in his head, and the sergeant received three stitches in his hand. They were released from the hospital and have returned to duty. The 38-year-old subject succumbed to his injuries later that day. The subject, who was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident, had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime.",139
"Two officers with the Henry County Police Department were shot and wounded in Stockbridge on April 4 while responding to a call from a concerned citizen who reported an unresponsive, pregnant female in a nearby garage and blood in the driveway. The caller did not know if the woman was in labor or if it was another issue. Both officers were wearing body cameras, which recorded the incident. Around 10:45 a.m., the two officers arrived at the residence named in the complaint. The garage door was closed, but the officers were able to look inside and see a woman lying on the floor. Unable to gain entry through the garage, the officers went to the front door of the home. With their firearms in their holsters, the officers decided to perform a forced entry to render aid to the female. The 33-year-old officer, who was a 9-year veteran of law enforcement, kicked down the door, and he was immediately met with gunfire from inside the home. The officer was hit in the front below the waist/groin area and front upper torso/chest, but his body armor prevented the bullet from striking him. Despite his blunt-force trauma injuries, the officer was able to make it into the garage. The other officer retreated outside, and the offender continued to shoot at him through a front window. Other officers responded to the scene while the suspect continued to fire rounds. One of the backup officers kicked out the door panels of the garage, allowing the injured officer to escape. Officers set up a perimeter around the house and were awaiting SWAT when the offender yelled out the window that he had a hostage. A few minutes later, the offender fired a shot that struck the other officer who was first to arrive at the scene. The 32-year-old officer, who was also wearing body armor, was struck in his arms/hands. The 7-year veteran of law enforcement was able to crawl to a tree for cover. The 47-year-old offender, who used both a .38-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a 9 mm handgun, eventually killed his juvenile hostage before committing suicide. The woman in the garage also died. The offender had prior arrests for aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, resisting arrest, and a weapons violation. Both officers were taken to a local hospital with critical injuries. The 9-year veteran officer has since returned to duty. The 7-year veteran officer had not returned to duty at the time this incident was reported to the FBI.",188

"On March 11, a 34-year-old trooper first class with the Maryland State Police was stabbed while answering a call for service involving the malicious destruction of property. Around 7 a.m., the trooper, a veteran of law enforcement with 5 years of experience, was dispatched to an address in Westminster. He had been called to the same address the previous day, also regarding the malicious destruction of property. The trooper arrived at the scene at 7:14 a.m. and began speaking with the complainant.

"A 30-year-old agent with the Roswell Police Department was shot while assisting with a drug-related special assignment around 8:40 p.m. on July 31. The veteran agent, who had more than 5 years of law enforcement experience, was part of the Chaves County Metro Narcotics Task Force (CCMNTF). Agents with the CCMNTF, along with the FBI, were conducting a long-term investigation of a drug trafficking organization. Agents received information that the main subject of the investigation had arranged to meet an unknown methamphetamine supplier from Arizona in the parking lot of a restaurant in Roswell. Agents also learned that another individual, a close associate of the main subject, had traveled to Albuquerque with the subject earlier that morning. According to the information, the pair would be returning to Roswell later in the evening to acquire the methamphetamine from the supplier. Because of information gleaned from their long-term investigation, the agents had prior knowledge that the associate of the main subject reportedly possessed multiple firearms and was a heavy methamphetamine user. While traveling to the restaurant, the agents spotted the subject and his associate at a gas station. The agents continued to the meeting place and set up surveillance in and around the restaurant’s parking lot. Eventually, the vehicles belonging to both the subject and the supplier arrived. The main subject who arranged the meeting exited his vehicle and approached the supplier’s vehicle. Multiple agents approached both vehicles on foot, made verbal contact with the subject and the supplier, and ordered the associate, who was in the passenger seat of the subject’s vehicle, to show his hands. By this time, the associate already had his car door open and, without warning, fired two rounds from a .45-caliber revolver in the direction of the agents located at the rear of the vehicle. The second round struck the victim agent, who was wearing body armor, in the front lower torso/stomach. The victim agent fired two rounds from his service weapon at the suspect before falling to the ground; however, both rounds missed the suspect.
