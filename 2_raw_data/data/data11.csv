"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm. The victim officer was wounded in the front upper chest, rear lower back, and fatally in the neck above his protective vest. The suspect then fled in the officer’s patrol vehicle, which he later abandoned. Officers found the 28-year-old male at a relative’s residence.

The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process.

"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

The 25-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record and was known to have prior mental disorders.",1187
"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene.

"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head.

The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands.

"On June 9 around 7 p.m., a 38-year-old investigator with the Nash County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed during a tactical situation while attempting to serve First-Degree Murder warrants in Kinston. The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia. The suspect had a prior criminal record and was found to be under the influence of alcohol and narcotics at the time of the incident. Just before 1 a.m. on February 23, a 44-year-old trooper with the Washington State Patrol, Bremerton, requested information on a vehicle during a traffic stop in Gorst. When dispatchers could not make further contact with the trooper, a deputy sheriff was sent to investigate and found the veteran trooper, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience and who was wearing body armor, along the roadside with a single gunshot wound to the front of his head from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The victim trooper was transported to a nearby hospital and confirmed dead. About four hours after the shooting, the vehicle in question was found abandoned a few miles from the scene. Investigators learned the owner of the abandoned vehicle had obtained a ride to a friend’s property in a nearby town.

"A 43-year-old deputy sheriff with the Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s Office (PCSO) was killed, and a 59-year-old deputy sheriff with the PCSO was wounded in Council Bluffs while transporting prisoners at 10:55 a.m. on May 1. The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail. The male prisoner exited the back of the van and immediately began assaulting the 43-year-old deputy, a 16-year law enforcement veteran, with a homemade cutting instrument, cutting the deputy’s head, neck, arms/hands, and front legs/feet. With the deputy down, the suspect ran to the driver’s seat of the van. The injured deputy, who was wearing body armor, recovered and entered the van through the front passenger’s side door. The 59-year-old deputy, who was also wearing body armor, ran to the driver’s side of the van to attempt to apprehend the suspect. During the struggle, the suspect gained possession of one of the deputy’s service weapons, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The suspect fatally shot the injured 43-year-old deputy in the side of the head with the service weapon. The suspect then shot the 59-year-old deputy in the front lower torso/abdomen below his protective vest and took possession of the other deputy’s service weapon. The injured 59-year-old deputy fell to the ground outside the van. The suspect exited the van and took the van keys and extra ammunition from the 59-year-old deputy. The suspect got back in the van, started it with the stolen keys, and fled the scene by ramming the closed sally port door. At 10:57 a.m., the suspect pulled up behind two motorists in a pickup truck at an intersection. The truck driver noticed the suspect exiting the van dressed in a yellow jumpsuit carrying a firearm and realized the man was an escaped prisoner. As the suspect attempted to open the driver’s side door of the truck, the truck driver tried to drive away, but the suspect fired one round through the truck’s window, striking the driver in the neck. The injured motorist continued driving until he drove into a ditch north of the intersection. The suspect returned to the van and fled. A few minutes later, the suspect drove up behind another vehicle stopped at a stop sign. The suspect drove past the vehicle and parked in front of it in the middle of an intersection. The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody. He had a criminal history that included murder charges. The deputies were transported to a local hospital where the 43-year-old deputy was pronounced dead.

"A 34-year-old senior deputy with the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office was killed, and three additional law enforcement officers were injured, while attempting to restrain and control a suspect during an investigative activity shortly before 4 p.m. on February 5 in Colorado Springs. The deputy, an 11-year veteran of law enforcement, was part of a multiagency motor vehicle theft task force. Earlier that afternoon, the task force was notified of a stolen vehicle that had been spotted in several areas throughout El Paso County. Task force members found the vehicle at an apartment complex, even though the suspect stopped at several locations and spray painted it in an attempt to disguise it. Members of the task force identified the suspect alone in the parking lot. The 34-year-old deputy and a 29-year-old deputy approached the suspect as he walked to the stolen vehicle. The two deputies grabbed the suspect and attempted to take him into custody. The suspect pulled out a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shot the 29-year-old deputy once in the front lower torso/abdomen below his body armor. The suspect wrestled with the 34-year-old deputy and continued firing his weapon, fatally striking him in the rear upper torso/back and the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. A 45-year-old sergeant with the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office and a 44-year-old detective with the Colorado Springs Police Department, both members of the task force and also wearing body armor, exchanged gunfire with the suspect. Both the sergeant and detective were injured. Despite his injuries, the detective returned gunfire striking the 19-year-old suspect in the front upper torso/chest, justifiably killing him.

The officer followed the vehicle to a residential area, but the driver eluded him. While attempting to locate the vehicle, the officer received  a radio assignment to assist another officer with a person suspected of driving under the influence. As the officer was turning around, he saw the vehicle he had been pursuing now parked in the middle of the street.

"At 10:37 p.m. on June 23, a deputy sheriff with the Comal County Sheriff’s Office was shot while handling a person with a mental illness in Bulverde. The deputy, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, responded to a residence where a man reportedly had a firearm and was suicidal. The caller was a family member and said he believed the man intended to attempt “suicide by cop.” When the 35-year-old deputy, along with three officers from the Bulverde Police Department (BPD), pulled up to the residence, they saw a man walking around with a firearm in his hand. The deputy and officers drew their weapons and ordered the man several times to put down the weapon, telling him they were there to help.

The 20-year veteran sergeant was one of three officers who were dispatched to a local hotel to deal with a 911 caller who was incoherent and agitated, using methamphetamine, and armed with a knife which had a blade approximately 3 to 4 inches long. The caller repeatedly told dispatchers he had “committed crimes and hurt people.” The officers, who obtained a room key from management, spent some time speaking with the subject and trying to get him to open the door. A fourth officer, who was certified to use an electronic control weapon (ECW) arrived on the scene. When all attempts to get the man to come out of the room failed, the officers prepared to use the master key and a two-prong fork tool to disable the swing arm deadbolt lock. The door was unlocked, and the sergeant, who was wearing body armor, was operating the two-prong fork tool on the deadbolt when the subject thrust the knife through the narrow opening, striking the sergeant in the arms/hands. The fourth officer deployed the ECW on the suspect’s hand, and though only one prong hit, it was enough to cause the suspect to drop the knife. The officers forced the door open, and a second burst from the ECW made contact with the suspect’s chest. Officers were able to subdue and handcuff him. The 38-year-old suspect was taken to the city jail where he was placed in a restraint chair and incarcerated. The suspect, who had no reported prior criminal history, said he had been doing methamphetamine since the day before. The injured sergeant returned to duty after this incident.",663
"A veteran trooper with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol was shot and killed with his service weapon shortly before 7 a.m. on December 26 while investigating a suspicious person in Devol. A newspaper delivery person notified the 35-year-old officer at his residence of an unconscious individual in a vehicle on a rural road. The officer, with nearly 7 years of law enforcement experience, was not scheduled to go on duty until later in the day, but he donned his uniform and went to investigate the matter.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect.

When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased. The suspect was on parole and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident. His criminal history included arrests for a drug law violation and a violent crime. The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene. The sergeant was transported to an area hospital, but the multiple injuries that he suffered proved fatal. The stolen truck was found abandoned in another area of the city, and the 19- year-old suspect was located later that same day. He was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. The suspect was subsequently found unconscious in his jail cell and later died. The cause of death had not been determined at the time of this report.",624
"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area). The responding officer returned fire, justifiably killing the 35-year-old suspect. Both injured officers were transported to a local hospital where the 22-year-old officer succumbed to his injury on March 31. The deceased offender was later found to have marijuana and cocaine in a bag tied to his belt and concealed in his clothes. Friends of the suspect reported he had told them he did not want to go back to prison and would “do what he had to do to stay out.” The suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, police assault, weapons violations, and drug violations, had been convicted previously. The suspect was also a registered sex offender.",547
"On April 18 at 4 p.m., a police officer with the Phoenix Police Department was shot while handling a person with a mental illness. The 34-year-old officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 7 years’ experience, was one of the officers who responded to a city park. Dispatchers had received a call from a person at the park who said he was sitting in a van and that men were pointing guns at him from bushes and houses in the area. Officers who arrived in the area made contact with the subject who appeared to be paranoid and delusional. The subject was in the driver’s seat and told the officers that he believed various people (including the police) were out to kill him, so he locked the doors and refused to exit. Officers used their equipment to conduct a search and electronically located an existing mental health order on the subject. They planned to remove the man from the vehicle and take him to a local mental health facility. One officer shot pepper spray through an opening in one of the vehicle’s windows while another officer, who was wearing body armor, broke out the passenger window. The subject pulled a semiautomatic handgun from behind his back and fired at the officer who had broken the window’s glass, striking the officer in his front upper torso/chest. The officer also suffered an eye injury (front head). Another officer fired at the subject, justifiably killing him. The subject was later discovered to have a history of a mental illness and a prior criminal record. The victim officer had not returned to duty at the time this incident was reported to the FBI.",1166
"A deputy sheriff with the Muskingum County Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed during a traffic stop on January 8 in Zanesville. The 39-year-old deputy sheriff, with more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, radioed a registration request on a license plate at 6 p.m. and also indicated that same car was parked at a residence where someone was flagging him down. A short time later, a male caller placed a 911 cell phone call to report that a deputy was down. Arriving at the scene, the investigators found the veteran deputy, who was wearing body armor, fatally shot in the left side of the head. They recovered a .45-caliber shell casing as well as the victim deputy’s pocket notebook, opened to a page that had a Social Security number written on it. Investigators soon learned that the number was assigned to the boyfriend of the suspect vehicle’s owner. Moreover, he had been seen driving the car earlier in the day, and he had picked up his girlfriend at her place of employment shortly after the shooting. Officers spotted the vehicle later that evening, however, and the driver pulled away when deputies tried to stop the car. The occupants later abandoned the car and fled on foot to a wooded area where they were apprehended. The suspect had a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in his possession and admitted to deputies that he had shot an officer.

"A deputy sheriff with the Storey County Sheriff’s Office was injured while handling a person with a mental illness on January 2 just before 4:30 p.m. in Virginia City Highlands. The 44-year-old deputy, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, responded to a call of a suicidal subject with a knife. The deputy radioed for backup, parked his patrol unit, and approached the residence on foot because of heavy snow. As the deputy neared the residence, he heard an argument from within the house. When he knocked on the door of the residence and announced himself, the deputy heard a man inside the house making violent threats toward him. The deputy convinced the subject’s wife to exit the house; however, she came outside barefoot and, due to the deep snow, was forced to remain near the house. As he approached the wife, the deputy heard the sound of a bolt being racked in a rifle. Then, from within the house, the subject announced he was going to kill the deputy. Without further warning, the suspect fired 13 rounds at the deputy with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle from a first-floor window. One round struck the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the rear lower torso/back and knocked him to the ground; however, his protective vest prevented a potentially lethal injury. The suspect’s wife, who was standing near the deputy, was struck in the left leg by bullet fragments. The victim deputy regained his footing and fired six rounds from his service weapon into the window where the suspect had been shooting. The deputy then repositioned himself near the rear of the residence. Several minutes later, the suspect, wounded in his right arm and upper torso by flying glass, gave up and exited the house. As the deputy approached, the suspect once again became aggressive, and the deputy used his electronic control weapon twice to immobilize the suspect. The deputy handcuffed the suspect and took him into custody. The 51-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a drug law violation, was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.

Apparently, the 15-year veteran law enforcement officer, who was off duty at the time of the incident, was in the vestibule of an apartment building when a young male approached him brandishing a weapon and announcing a robbery. A gunfight ensued that culminated in the deaths of both the officer and his 16-year-old assailant. The self-announced robber fired three shots from a .32-caliber revolver and fatally struck the officer in his upper torso. The victim officer returned fire, hitting his attacker with ten rounds.

The officer was transported to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead.",685
"A sergeant with the Bellaire Police Department was killed after a traffic stop and pursuit shortly before 9 a.m. on December 24. The 53-year-old veteran sergeant, who had more than 27 years of law enforcement experience, was on patrol in his marked patrol unit when he noticed a vehicle matching the description of one that had been used in area robberies a few weeks earlier. The sergeant followed the vehicle and observed the driver exceeding the posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour. The sergeant initiated a traffic stop and ordered the driver to exit his vehicle, but the driver sped off. The sergeant called for backup, and a high-speed chase ensued during which the suspect hit a truck. The driver of the truck began pursuing the suspect as well, at times obscuring the sergeant’s view of the suspect’s vehicle. After approximately ¾ of a mile, the suspect pulled the vehicle into a parking lot of an automobile body shop in Houston and came to a stop after striking a dumpster. The pickup truck pulled into the lot, followed by the sergeant. The sergeant exited his patrol unit, again ordered the suspect to get out of his vehicle, and then began to struggle to gain control of him through the partially open driver’s door. The owner of the body shop approached the vehicle in an attempt to assist the sergeant. The patrol unit’s dashboard camera showed that the sergeant struggled with the driver for about 30 seconds until the driver retrieved a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun from inside the vehicle and fatally shot the sergeant at close range in the front of the head. The suspect then exited the vehicle and fatally shot the body shop owner in the front upper torso/chest. The suspect pointed his firearm at the driver of the pickup truck, but additional law enforcement officers arrived at the scene. The suspect fired on them, then fled on foot.

The veteran trooper, who had 12 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a truck around 12:10 a.m. When he approached the truck on foot, the driver fired multiple rounds from close range, then fled the scene. Two rounds struck the trooper in the side of his head and the front upper torso/chest. He died at the scene. A passerby discovered the trooper’s body a few minutes later and contacted the authorities. When officers arrived, they reviewed the video from the trooper’s dashboard camera and issued an all points bulletin for the truck. Approximately an hour after the shooting, a Fair Bluff Police Department officer observed the suspect’s truck. The officer and the driver engaged in a short chase followed by a foot chase before the officer lost sight of the suspect.

The suspect was on probation for firearm-related offenses. The truck had been stolen from a business in Chadbourn. In an interview conducted by special agents with North Carolina’s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI), the suspect said he had no knowledge of the shooting and claimed he had rented the truck from an unknown individual. He said he fled from law enforcement officers in Fair Bluff because he had been drinking and driving. The suspect was arrested and charged with First-Degree Murder. ",29
"Around 3:15 p.m. on May 12, police officers with the Greenville Police Department were dispatched to a residence on a domestic disturbance call. During the incident, a 50-year-old veteran officer with 29 years of law enforcement experience was injured with a knife. Two officers initially responded to the scene of the domestic disturbance and found a man in the yard of the residence. He explained he had called the police because his roommate was “off his medication” and had punched him. Dispatchers had warned the officers that the suspect may be armed with a knife, and the roommate confirmed he was. The officers began walking toward the residence as the suspect came around the west side of the house. One of the officers knew the suspect, and it was clear the suspect disliked that officer. Because of the suspect’s hostility, the other officer took over interviewing the suspect about the situation. The suspect admitted that he punched his roommate in the head saying it was “because he wouldn’t give me a cigarette.” The officer told the suspect she needed to search him for weapons, and the suspect reluctantly agreed. The suspect was unarmed, and the officer began to pull his arms around to handcuff him. The suspect spun around, took an aggressive stance, and backed away from the officers. One officer pulled out his electronic control device (ECD), and the other officer told the suspect to stop or her partner would use the ECD. The suspect indicated he didn’t care if they did and continued backing away. The first officer told her partner to discharge the ECD, but the suspect turned and fled The officers called for backup as they chased the suspect, who forcefully threw a large piece of wood with a steel latch at them. The object missed the officers, and the suspect retreated into the house. The officers secured both the front and rear of the residence as other officers arrived to assist. One of the initial officers on the scene spoke with a K-9 officer and told him the suspect was not concerned about the threat of an ECD, but he might respond to a K-9. By this time, several officers were on the front porch. One tried the front door and found it to be unlocked. They called to the suspect to come out. When he did not respond, one officer opened the door and found the suspect standing at the foot of a nearby staircase holding a knife. Officers instructed the man to drop the knife or they would use an ECD on him. (The K-9 was also ready to be deployed.) The suspect then threw the knife at the officers. The handle grazed the head of one officer and struck a 50-year-old veteran officer (who was wearing body armor) in the front of the head, causing a large gash on his chin and profuse bleeding. Officers deployed three ECD cartridges on the suspect with minimal effect, but he surrendered after the K-9 subdued him. The suspect, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, continued to struggle after he was handcuffed and taken to the front yard to receive medical assistance. The suspect was subsequently transported to the hospital to have the K-9 bite treated. The victim officer, who was in shock, was also taken to the hospital where he received 11 stitches for the cut on his chin. The 26-year- old suspect had a prior criminal record including a violent crime and drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. The suspect was charged with Assault Causing Bodily Injury—Family Violence; two counts of Aggravated Assault on a Peace Officer; and Resisting Arrest, Search, or Transport, with a Deadly Weapon.

The individual, who was known to law enforcement for several previous domestic violence calls, had punched the woman’s daughter and granddaughter. The woman scared the man away by firing shots into the ground and reported to dispatch that she did not think he was armed. Around the same time, a neighbor also called 911 to report the disturbance and provided a description of the truck the man was driving. The lieutenant located the suspect’s truck and conducted a traffic stop. At 7:18 a.m., a passing motorist called dispatchers to report an officer down at the location of the traffic stop. Another officer responded to the scene where he found the lieutenant critically wounded by rounds from his own service weapon, a .40- caliber semiautomatic handgun.

"A 38-year-old patrol officer with the El Paso Police Department was shot and killed on September 25 shortly before 1 a.m., responding to three calls regarding a domestic disturbance/assault-in-progress incident. The calls had been made by a woman reporting that her husband had entered the house with the intent to assault her; she did not report he had a weapon.

"On April 10 around 11:30 a.m., a Rotterdam Police Department (RPD) patrol officer was assaulted while responding to a call concerning a man with a mental illness. The 43-year-old officer, a veteran with 18 years of law enforcement experience, and a sergeant also with the RPD were dispatched to check the welfare of a mentally ill man. The man’s mother called and said her son was damaging property inside her residence. The man was a military veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had not been taking his medication. Due to the nature of the call, the sergeant requested a Schenectady County Sheriff’s unit also be dispatched. The three officers arrived and spoke with the man’s mother outside of the residence before attempting to contact the man. The mother stated her son had a knife in each hand and was making stabbing motions at her. As the three officers approached the residence, the sergeant and the sheriff’s deputy had their electronic control weapons (ECWs) drawn. The officer also had his service weapon ready. The sergeant called for the man to come out from the front doorway. After receiving no response, the sergeant entered and began searching for the man, calling to him throughout the residence. The sergeant and the officer located the man in a first floor bedroom hiding behind a door. The sergeant noticed a knife on a dresser inside the room. He reached in, grabbed the knife, and threw it down the hallway. The officer called out for the man to drop any weapons he had, but he verbally refused. The sergeant pushed open the door, pinning the man between the door and the wall. The officer continued to order him to drop any weapons and come out.

The plainclothes officer, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 10 years’ experience, was driving an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows and was accompanied by another officer. They came upon a vehicle that was driving erratically—swerving in and out of lanes and running red lights—so they began following it. The officers got close enough to the vehicle to notice it had a temporary license plate number. They radioed in to check the license status and the response indicated the temporary tag was stolen. The officers requested a follow-up to see if the vehicle’s make and model was also listed as stolen.

However, the suspect refused to drop his gun, and he and the off-duty officer, who had nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience, exchanged gunfire. The off-duty officer fired at the shooter, who fell to the ground near the back of a pickup truck. After the first shooter fell, the bouncer came out of the nightclub, approached the parking lot, and fired several rounds from a 9 mm revolver at the off-duty officer whom he believed was the initial shooter. The off-duty officer then fell to the ground. The officer in the adjacent lot informed dispatch of the shooting, went to the nightclub’s lot, and began securing the scene. The victim officer was lying between two vehicles bleeding from an unknown location with his firearm near his side. Emergency personnel transported him to a local hospital, where he was treated for a fatal gunshot wound to his neck and one to his left arm; he died shortly thereafter. The 30-year-old male, who had a prior criminal record and had been justifiably shot by the victim officer, died at the scene. The 30-year-old bouncer, who had a non-law enforcement relationship with the victim officer, was arrested and charged with Second-Degree Murder.",322
"A sergeant with the Montrose Police Department was killed and two officers were wounded at 9:40 p.m., July 25, when they were responding to a domestic incident. The 41-year-old sergeant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, was called to a home at 8:30 p.m. to assist two officers who were dealing with a person under the influence of alcohol. The person had barricaded himself in a detached garage. The sergeant, along with the intoxicated man’s family members, negotiated with the man for more than an hour. When negotiations failed, the sergeant decided to forcibly enter the garage in order to arrest the man. Family members assured the officers that though there were weapons in the garage, the man inside did not have a key to the locked container, which they called a “gun safe.” Upon the police breaking through the door, however, the man began shooting at them with a 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun. The assailant fired four times. All three law enforcement members were wearing body armor; however, the victim sergeant was fatally struck in the upper torso when a bullet entered the armhole of his protective vest. The other two officers were wounded. One, who was 53 years old and had 18 years of law enforcement experience, was shot in the left leg. The other, who was 24 years old and had 2 years of law enforcement experience, was struck in both legs. Although these two officers returned fire, the 52-year-old offender was not hit and retreated to a bathroom in the garage where he committed suicide. What had been described as a “gun safe” was a gun locker made of sheet metal. The shooter had used hand tools in the garage to peel the metal away and had gained access to the weapons inside. The shooter, who had prior mental disorders, knew the sergeant through a law enforcement relationship. He had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime conviction and was on probation at the time of the incident.",566
"On September 16 at 1:22 p.m., a 41-year-old deputy sheriff with the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office responded to a complaint about a suspicious person trying to steal a four-wheeler in rural Sedgwick County. The deputy, an 18-year law enforcement veteran, located the suspect 4 miles from the original scene. The suspect’s truck had broken down, and a family member of the original complainant had stopped to assist. The deputy began to question the suspect, who was standing outside the open passenger door of the truck. During the questioning, the suspect, who was known to the sheriff’s office as being a dealer of controlled substances, showed his holstered firearm to the deputy. The deputy removed the .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the suspect’s holster and placed it in the bed of the truck. Coincidentally, the deputy had taken a report about the theft of the same firearm 4 hours earlier. The deputy attempted to take the suspect into custody, but the suspect struggled, grabbed the handgun from the bed of the truck, and fired three rounds at the deputy. One of the rounds struck the deputy in the front upper torso/chest, circumventing his body armor. The deputy drew his service weapon and pursued the suspect into a ditch. The deputy shot the suspect four times—justifiably killing him—before succumbing to his own injuries. Initial responding units found the deputy’s body at the feet of the deceased 29-year-old suspect. The suspect’s criminal history included charges for a drug law violation and other violent crime. He had also been previously incarcerated.",957

The deputy, who had nearly 2½ years of law enforcement experience, was responding to a call for assistance regarding a vehicle that had failed to stop for another unit and was fleeing at high speeds. En route to the pursuit, dispatch advised that the driver had turned around and was heading toward the deputy’s location. After communicating with his supervisor, the deputy stopped and began deploying a tire-deflation device in an effort to end the pursuit. The deputy was subsequently struck by the fleeing vehicle and sustained fatal injuries. The assailant continued to flee and attempted to run over a second officer who had deployed another tire- deflation device. The assailant missed the second officer but struck the device, which disabled his vehicle. When the assailant’s car came to a stop, he exited it and attempted to escape on foot. Officers apprehended him and, after some resistance, took him into custody. Immediate efforts were made to render aid to the victim deputy; however, he succumbed to his injuries. Further investigation revealed that the assailant intentionally struck the deputy with his vehicle while fleeing. The 40-year-old assailant was a known drug dealer and had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime, police assault, drug violations, and weapons violations, and had been convicted previously.

"A deputy sheriff from the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department (PCSD) was killed on January 7 when he answered a call for service regarding a home invasion robbery in Frederickson. At 11:24 p.m., the PCSD dispatcher received a call reporting an intruder in the caller’s mobile home. The dispatcher could hear sounds of screaming and a struggle. In subsequent interviews, PCSD detectives determined that at the time of the invasion, there were three males, one female, and two small children living in the mobile home. All of the residents except for one male roommate were inside when the invasion occurred. The three adult victims reported that they heard a knock at the back door, then the doorknob being jiggled, and a kitchen window breaking. A victim reported seeing the first suspect, masked and carrying a handgun, climb through the broken window, then unlock and open the door for the second suspect, who was also masked and armed with a handgun and a long knife. One of the victims grabbed a baseball bat and struck the first suspect in the head, while another victim called 911. The first suspect struggled with the victim as the second suspect searched the house for cash and narcotics. At 11:29 p.m., the 34-year-old deputy arrived at the scene. The deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with 9 years of experience, pulled up behind two newly arrived vehicles at the residence. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, spoke with the occupants of the vehicles, who indicated one of them lived at the mobile home and the other was a friend. Meanwhile, the victims and the suspects saw the fourth roommate’s vehicle and the deputy’s patrol vehicle pull into the driveway. The suspects panicked and ran from the home as two of the victims jumped out of the windows. The deputy ordered the suspects to get on the ground, but they did not comply. At 11:33 p.m., the deputy notified dispatch that he was in pursuit of two suspects who were running through the yard toward the street. Twenty seconds later, the deputy reported shots fired. When the dispatcher replied to the deputy, there was no response. The dispatcher remotely opened the deputy’s portable radio microphone to listen for communication. At 11:37 p.m., backup deputies arrived on the scene and found the victim deputy along a path. He had been fatally shot once in the neck/throat. Deputies and medical personnel attempted life-saving measures, but the Pierce County Medical Examiner determined the victim deputy had died instantly. Deputies also located the body of a 35-year-old suspect. The suspect was wearing a ballistic vest that had been struck by four .40-caliber rounds in the torso area. The rounds were consistent with the fallen deputy’s service weapon, a semiautomatic handgun. Deputies searched the area and found a safe and a backpack that had been stolen from the residence as well as the suspect’s .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Further investigation determined that the suspect had fired three rounds at the victim deputy at close range; only one round struck the deputy. The suspect was known to the PCSD for previous criminal contacts and possessing a controlled substance. His criminal history included previous incarceration and a previous violent crime. Officers locked down the area in an attempt to find the second suspect. At 8:11 a.m. the next morning, a Washington State Patrol trooper working traffic control along the perimeter reported seeing a suspicious person in the area. A PCSD sergeant spoke with the person, who was wet, shivering, dirty, and appeared to be suffering from the onset of hypothermia. His pants were ripped, and he had large cuts on his hands. The suspect had a bear-spray holster and a pocketknife but was otherwise unarmed. He told officers his name and said he was walking in the area to visit his girlfriend and provided a false name. Officers determined the provided name was false and the suspect had three active warrants. He was transported to the Pierce County Jail. Detectives linked the suspect directly to the homicide using evidence such as text messages between the suspect and his girlfriend regarding the incident and video of the suspect hiding in a nearby industrial area and in a garbage can. Detectives arrested the 32-year-old suspect on January 8 and charged him with First-Degree Murder, First-Degree Kidnapping, and Unlawful Possession of a Firearm. The suspect was known to law enforcement for previous criminal contacts and as a dealer, user, and possessor of a controlled substance. His criminal history included previous incarceration and previous arrests for assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, and a violent crime.

"On April 24 at 4:11 p.m., a 27-year-old police officer with the Dallas Police Department (DPD) was fatally injured and a 26-year-old DPD police officer was severely injured while answering a nonemergency call for service at a home improvement store. Earlier, an off-duty police officer and a loss prevention officer had detained a subject at the store. The off-duty officer called for on-duty officers to respond to the location to confirm the subject’s identity. Upon their arrival, the two responding officers remained with the loss prevention officer and the subject while the off-duty officer went to the patrol vehicle, where he confirmed that the subject had an active felony warrant for his arrest. The off-duty officer called the loss prevention officer by phone to notify him of the warrant, and the loss prevention officer relayed the information to the two on-duty officers. The two officers attempted to handcuff the subject, but he pulled a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from the pocket of his shorts and fired seven rounds at the officers. Both DPD officers, who were wearing body armor, were wounded in the front of their heads. The loss prevention officer began fighting with the offender over the firearm and was shot several times during the struggle. The subject fled the store, got into a truck, and left the scene. The loss prevention officer used one of the DPD officers’ radios to report two officers down and the location of the store. All three were transported to a hospital, where the 27-year-old officer, who had 3 years of law enforcement experience, died the following morning. The 26-year-old officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, spent three weeks in the hospital and had not yet returned to work at the time this report was submitted to the FBI.

At 4:21 a.m., the 911 call center received two calls regarding the same stretch of interstate—one to report an individual shooting at a vehicle and one to report an individual dragging another person from the road. At 4:33 a.m., the 52-year-old veteran trooper, who had 27 years of law enforcement experience, responded to the scene and discovered a rollover vehicle crash. He asked dispatch to request a helicopter for a female had been ejected from the vehicle. Shortly after, the trooper informed dispatch he had closed one lane of traffic. About that time, a man who had been involved in the crash emerged and fired a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at the trooper. One round struck the trooper in the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. The suspect then sat on top of the trooper and struck him repeatedly in the face with both fists. A citizen and his companion driving past the scene noticed the assault and stopped to assist the trooper. The citizen—armed with a personally-owned firearm—approached the scene on foot and ordered the suspect to get off the trooper. The suspect ignored the citizen’s command and resumed beating the trooper; the citizen fired two rounds that struck the suspect in the thigh and the head. The rounds knocked the suspect off the trooper allowing the citizen to administer first aid to the trooper. Suddenly, the suspect recovered and lunged at the pair, so the citizen fired another round that struck the suspect in the head a second time. During this time, the citizen’s companion called 911 to report their location to dispatch and used the trooper’s first aid kit to administer additional care to the trooper. The citizen began to flag down traffic and a third person stopped his vehicle to assist. He used the trooper’s radio to again request help. About 6 minutes after the third person called for help, a DPS sergeant arrived and secured the area. The victim trooper was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he underwent multiple surgeries to repair a gunshot wound to his right shoulder and numerous facial lacerations and contusions.

The officer, a 9-year law enforcement veteran, was off duty but was wearing his police uniform as he worked in a security role at a local restaurant. The officer was eating in the bar area out of view of the front door, when three men, their faces partially covered by their jacket hoods, entered the restaurant.

A chase ensued during which the suspect apparently stopped his vehicle twice for periods of 10–20 minutes, but he did not respond to officers’ attempts to negotiate his surrender. Officers from two other municipal departments assisted in the pursuit, and a fourth municipal department deployed tire deflation devices that flattened three of the tires on the suspect’s vehicle. However, the suspect drove off again, and the veteran trooper, who had nearly 11 years’ law enforcement experience, and his partner joined the chase. They followed two of the municipal police vehicles on a route parallel to the pursuit route in an apparent attempt to head off the suspect. As the two municipal vehicles and the state police vehicle turned right onto a connecting street, the suspect reportedly turned left onto the same street, heading directly at oncoming police cars. Though the first municipal car avoided impact with the suspect, the second collided with him. The suspect swerved across the street and struck a utility pole near the state police car that was stopped with no room to continue forward. He then allegedly exited his vehicle with a gun in each hand and fired at the state police vehicle from a distance of approximately 7 yards. Wearing body armor and using his car for cover, the trooper, his partner, and municipal officers all returned fire. The suspect allegedly fired at least eight rounds; one bullet from a .41 magnum handgun struck the victim trooper in the forehead over his left eye. Officers hit the suspect in the torso and extremities with approximately 12 rounds before he collapsed. Both the victim trooper and the suspect were treated by emergency medical technicians at the scene and flown to a nearby hospital where they both underwent surgery. However, the victim trooper died of massive brain injuries the following day. The 45-year-old suspect, who had a previous arrest for DUI and was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident, recovered from his wounds and was charged with First-Degree Murder, one count of Criminal Homicide, two counts of Criminal Attempt/Criminal Homicide, six counts of Aggravated Assault, eight counts of Recklessly Endangering Another Person, and one count of Fleeing or Attempting to Elude Police Officers.",691
"Alabama Bureau of Investigation arrived on the scene and reviewed footage from the victim officer’s dash-mounted camera that showed the victim officer approaching the driver’s side of the suspect’s car, speaking to the driver, and returning to the patrol car. The officer approached the suspect’s vehicle a second time and engaged in another conversation with the driver. As the officer looked down at his ticket book, the man produced a handgun. The white flash of an apparent gunshot appeared on the video, and the victim officer fell to the ground. Police from nearby Trussville, who had heard the description of the murder suspect and the vehicle he was driving, recognized the description of the car as one belonging to the brother of a Trussville police officer. Meanwhile, in Birmingham, the Birmingham Police Department received a telephone call about a man who was trying to break into vehicles and subsequently was seen getting into a truck driven by an unidentified individual. Birmingham officers issued an alert for the truck, and an officer in Trussville reported seeing a truck matching this description speeding through Trussville approximately 1 hour after the shooting incident in Pelham. Officers from Birmingham subsequently located an abandoned car matching the description of the shooting suspect’s vehicle. It appeared to have blood on the driver’s side doors and roof. Shortly thereafter, the suspect, in a truck driven by his brother, approached cruisers from the Hoover Police Department parked at an exit by the side of the highway. As police officers apprehended the man, he stated, “I’m the guy you’re looking for.” After a tip from the suspect’s brother, police found the weapon used in the murder of the victim officer in the glove compartment of the truck. The 29-year-old suspect, who had no previous criminal history, was charged with Capital Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer.",592
"A 39-year-old sergeant with the Seaside Police Department (SPD) was fatally shot on February 5, while attempting an arrest. Around 9:20 p.m., the veteran sergeant, who had nearly 13 years of law enforcement experience, and another SPD officer attempted to arrest a subject who was wanted on a felony parole violation warrant. The subject resisted arrest and failed to comply with the officers’ commands to show his hands. The officer used an electronic control weapon to immobilize the subject, who fell to the ground. While on the ground, the subject fired one round from a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun, which he had concealed in his jacket. The round struck the sergeant in the front lower torso/stomach below his body armor. The other officer returned fire, striking the suspect. Additional officers arrived on the scene, handcuffed the suspect, and removed the concealed handgun from inside the suspect’s left jacket pocket. The sergeant was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injury. The 55-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included a violent crime, weapons violation, drug law violation, and an assaulting an officer/resisting arrest charge. The suspect was a known drug user and was under the influence of narcotics and alcohol at the time of the incident. He was also transported to an area hospital where he died.",373
"A 48-year-old patrol officer with the Saginaw Township Police Department was severely injured during a traffic stop on January 22 at 2:09 a.m. in Kochville Township. The officer, a veteran with nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, stopped a vehicle because the driver was not using headlights. Unknown to the officer, the driver had stolen the vehicle less than an hour earlier. The driver was wanted for escaping from a tether program and had multiple felony warrants for earlier motor vehicle and handgun thefts. Footage from the officer’s in-car dash camera showed the officer exited his patrol vehicle and approached the vehicle on the driver’s side. As the officer began speaking, the driver lifted a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun (which he had stolen 7 days earlier) from his lap where it was concealed. He thrust it at the officer’s face and fired two rounds. The first round struck the front of the officer’s head at close range, and the second struck his shoulder (upper torso) area outside the protective panel of his body armor. The offender immediately began to speed away as the officer drew his service weapon and fired two rounds, striking the tailgate of the stolen vehicle. The officer radioed dispatch and reported he’d been shot and gave a description of the suspect’s vehicle. A manhunt ensued until later that day when a detective with the Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Department located the offender on a roadway in another stolen vehicle. The offender suddenly stopped the car, got out, and pointed a firearm at the detective. The detective fired multiple rounds, striking the offender in the chest and face. The 29-year-old offender was arrested and charged with one count each of Attempted Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer, Felony Firearms Violation, Unlawful Driving Away in an Automobile, and Escape. His criminal history included charges for aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest, and a sex offense. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the wounded patrol officer had not yet returned to duty.",447
"Two police officers with the Detroit Police Department were killed during a traffic stop shortly after 1:50 a.m. on February 16. Investigators believe that the officers may have stopped an individual after they witnessed his attempt to solicit a prostitute. Apparently, the man exited his car, surrendered his driver’s license to the officers, and got into the backseat of the patrol car. While the officers, who were both wearing body armor, were running a check of the individual’s driver’s license, the suspect apparently pulled out a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer who was sitting in the front passenger seat in her face and head. The suspect then fired at the officer sitting in the driver’s seat, possibly wounding him. It appears that the suspect subsequently ran into a nearby field. Apparently, the officer who was the driver was able to get out of the vehicle and may have fired three shots at the suspect. The officer then checked on his partner and radioed that there was an officer down, which was his last transmission. Seemingly, the suspect returned to the scene and shot the officer in the head and torso under his protective vest. Responding officers found the officer lying about 60 feet from the patrol vehicle; his service weapon was missing. Police arrested a 19-year-old male and charged him in connection with the killings.",1052
"A 35-year-old deputy sheriff with the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office was fatally wounded on March 22 while conducting a traffic stop. Just after 2 a.m., the deputy, who was a veteran of law enforcement with 11 years’ experience, activated his patrol unit’s emergency lights and requested another patrol unit to assist as he made a traffic stop. Before assistance arrived, the deputy exited his patrol unit and approached the driver’s side of the stopped vehicle. Footage from the deputy’s body camera showed that the driver willingly answered the deputy’s questions and complied when the deputy asked him to exit the vehicle, first showing his hands out of the window and putting his wallet on top of the vehicle. However, as the driver exited his vehicle, he concealed a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun behind his leg (it was under his leg when he was inside the vehicle). As the offender stood up, he fired rounds toward the deputy’s face. The deputy attempted to gain distance by running toward his patrol unit when four rounds struck him in the front legs and fatally in the rear lower torso/back below his body armor. When the victim deputy fell to the ground, the 27-year-old offender approached and severely beat the victim deputy in the front of the head with the handgun. The offender, who was on conditional release pending criminal prosecution at the time of the incident, was arrested that same day. He had a criminal history that included domestic violence and a drug law violation. The victim deputy was transported to the hospital but succumbed to his injuries on March 24. The offender was charged with Capital Murder.",332
"A 47-year-old sergeant with the Franklin Parish Sheriff’s Office who had nearly 8 years of law enforcement experience was killed while responding to a disturbance call on July 15. Another sergeant with the same agency, 37 years old with nearly six years of law enforcement experience, was wounded, but was able to return to duty. The shooter was a resident who was angry about a crop duster treating a field adjacent to his home. The pilot of the crop duster was making passes over the field when he heard a noise and saw the resident pointing a gun at the plane. The owner of the crop dusting company contacted the sheriff’s office and requested that officers go to the man’s home and monitor him while the pilot of the crop duster finished treating the field. The two sergeants were part of a group of four officers who arrived at the home at 7:30 p.m. The resident, who was under the influence of alcohol, shot at the officers from more than 50 feet away using a 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun. After the initial shots, deputies told the man to put down his weapon. In spite of the order, the man fired his weapon again, prompting one sergeant to return fire. During the exchange, the victim sergeant, who was wearing a protective vest, suffered a fatal wound to the front of his head and injuries to his arms and hands. The second sergeant was wounded in his lower back when bullets entered below his protective vest. The wounded sergeant returned fire and justifiably killed the 61-year-old resident. The shooter had a criminal record that included police assault. The owner of the crop dusting company said that a year earlier he had a confrontation with that same resident over crop dusting near the individual’s home. At that time, the landowner had opted to treat the field using a tractor.",442
"A 54-year-old patrol officer with the St. Clair Township Police Department was shot and fatally wounded while responding to a domestic disturbance call on November 28. At 9:17 p.m., the officer, a 25-year veteran of law enforcement, was dispatched to a residence where a man and woman had been arguing. The woman told dispatchers that the man was intoxicated. She also reported he was armed with a rifle, had assaulted her, and had threatened to kill both her and himself. As she was on the phone with dispatchers, the man did something to cause the house to fill with smoke. According to the woman’s subsequent statement, when the officer responded to the scene, the officer ordered the man several times to, “Drop the gun.” The man refused and began screaming at the officer before lunging at him. The man fired three shots from a .270-caliber bolt-action rifle at the officer (who was wearing body armor); one round struck the officer in his front upper torso/chest by entering through the armhole or shoulder area of the bulletproof vest. The officer returned fire, and one round hit the offender in his shoulder. The injured offender fled the scene. The victim officer was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead from the gunshot wound to his chest. Approximately 6 hours later, the 31-year-old suspect was arrested while attempting to gain access to a nearby power plant. At the scene of the arrest, officers located the rifle used to kill the victim officer, ammunition, and the suspect’s bloody sweatshirt. The suspect, who was charged with Criminal Homicide, had a prior criminal record including a violent crime. He was on probation at the time of the incident and was a known drug user who was under the influence of alcohol when the shooting occurred.",194
"A police officer with the Norfolk Police Department was fatally shot shortly after 1:40 a.m. on January 16 while investigating a report of a gunshot victim at a sports bar. The veteran 39-year-old officer, with nearly 12 years of law enforcement experience, and her partner arrived at the bar and observed three subjects outside. The victim officer approached one male and her partner approached the other two subjects who were about 15 feet away. At this time, two additional officers arrived on the scene and split up to assist each officer. The one male began walking rapidly towards the police officer; she ordered him to stop as she began to back up. The suspect, a known drug dealer, pulled his weapon, a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and pointed it at the victim officer. The other three officers on the scene drew their weapons, and when the 35-year- old suspect fired, they returned gunfire, striking him 11 times. He died at the scene.

"Around 8:40 p.m. on December 22, a 28-year-old police officer with the San Francisco Police Department was fatally wounded while attempting to make an arrest. About 8:20 p.m., two other officers in a marked police vehicle spotted a prison escapee walking along the street. The officers made a U-turn but lost sight of the suspect. They believed he had jumped over backyard fences in an attempt to escape. The officers broadcast their location and requested backup to establish a perimeter. The victim officer, who had more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, and several other officers arrived at the location and set up a perimeter and began searching for the suspect in the backyards of the residences in the area. One of the officers spotted the man and broadcast his location. The officer told the suspect to stop, but he turned and ran, and the officer chased after him. The suspect kicked in a door to a commercial garage and ran inside. The victim officer arrived at the garage from a different direction and entered the building, followed by the officer who was chasing the suspect. Inside, the victim officer stood to the right of a closed door of a small interior room, and the second officer was to his left about 10 feet away. Neither of the officers knew that the suspect was in the small room. Suddenly, the door to the room flew open, and the second officer saw in the dimly lit garage the silhouette of a person, heard shots fired, and saw a muzzle flash coming from the doorway. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, dropped to the floor with a fatal gunshot wound to the front of his head from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The 33-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record that included drug arrests, violent crimes, police assault, and weapon violations, was killed at the scene apparently in the ensuing gunfire. However, the official cause of death is still pending. The victim officer was taken to a local hospital where he died the following day.",648
"Just before 10:15 p.m. on September 19, a deputy with the Caldwell County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) was shot and killed and a CCSO lieutenant was shot and injured in an ambush situation in Lenoir. In response to a 911 hang up call, the 25-year-old deputy, with 1 year’s law enforcement experience, arrived at a residence around 9:40 p.m. and began to investigate. Minutes later, he reported to communications that he had discovered an open door to the residence. Further investigation revealed a domestic dispute between a man and a woman. The woman was still inside the residence with three children, but the man had left the home, possibly armed, and had gone into the surrounding area. At 9:55 p.m., the deputy, who was wearing body armor, requested assistance from dispatch and began canvassing the immediate area. At 10:11 p.m., the 30-year-old lieutenant and an assisting deputy arrived on the scene. As they approached in their patrol unit, they saw the responding deputy standing near the rear of his patrol vehicle, and then, as they drove closer, they saw the victim deputy lying on the ground, mortally wounded. At that time, the officers were fired upon by multiple rounds. The lieutenant, a 7-year veteran of law enforcement, was hit in the front upper torso/chest from over 50 feet away. His protective vest stopped the round, but he sustained bruising and burning on his chest. The lieutenant then returned fire as he and the assisting deputy exited their patrol unit and sought cover. Additional officers responded to the scene, evacuated the victim deputy and the victim lieutenant, and drove them to an intersection where an ambulance waited to transport them to a local hospital. There, the victim deputy was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the front of the head from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle, and the victim lieutenant was treated and released. Following a 5-day manhunt, the 32-year-old suspect was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The victim lieutenant has since returned to duty.",756
"On September 24, just before 1 p.m., a 39-year-old deputy sheriff with the Lee County Sheriff’s Office died from wounds incurred while performing a traffic stop. The deputy, with nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner were on patrol when they spotted a vehicle with the driver behaving suspiciously. The deputies ran a check on the license plate and found that the license plate and vehicle information did not match. The deputy and a trainee partner, who was driving, pulled over the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle, the sole occupant, turned into the driveway of a residence, and the officers followed. Suddenly, the driver made a U-turn in the yard and attempted to pass the patrol car on the passenger side in order to flee. The deputy was stepping from the passenger side of the cruiser, and the suspect accelerated his vehicle, striking the victim deputy and pinning him under the vehicle. The victim deputy’s partner drew her sidearm and fired two rounds, after which the man surrendered.

The victim deputy was taken to a local hospital where he subsequently died.",963
"Just past 10:30 p.m. on March 6, a domestic disturbance call turned into a deadly ambush for Clinton Police Department officers. During the incident, a 30-year-old patrol officer with more than 3 years of experience was killed, and two patrol officers were injured. At approximately 9:20 p.m., officers were dispatched to a residence to handle a disturbance. The dispatcher reported there was an open-line 911 call at the residence, and it seemed two females were in a verbal confrontation. Several officers, including the 30-year-old patrol officer, arrived and made contact with a woman who came out of the front door of the residence. She told the officers that no one was inside. Shortly after, the patrol officer and others (all of whom were wearing body armor) entered the residence to perform a public safety check and were fired upon by an individual with a 9 mm semiautomatic rifle who was hidden in the bathroom. When the gunfire began, the officers returned gunfire and quickly retreated outside the residence. The gunfire continued after the officers left the building. A quick review by the officers and radio communications revealed that the patrol officer had been struck by rounds and was still inside the residence, incapacitated. In addition, a 35-year-old veteran patrol officer with 14 years of experience and a 25-year-old patrol officer with a little more than 1 year on the job had both sustained gunshot wounds to their right arms. Both wounded officers were taken to the hospital, treated, and subsequently returned to duty. The victim officer, who was still in the residence, was rescued from the house by a joint effort of the Bates County Sheriff’s Response Team and the Missouri State Highway Patrol Troop A Swat Team. The victim officer was taken to a nearby hospital and pronounced deceased from wounds to his front upper torso/chest (where a round entered through the armhole of his body armor), rear lower torso/back, legs and feet, rear legs, and a fatal shot to the front of the head.

"Around 2 p.m. on September 23, a 30-year-old police officer with the Philadelphia Police Department was shot and killed while investigating a suspicious person. At 1:47 p.m., the officer stopped a vehicle with a female driver and a male passenger. Within moments, the male passenger exited the vehicle to leave the scene, and the 8-year veteran officer pursued the man on foot around the corner of the block. Shortly thereafter, the man shot the officer at close range with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, striking him in the front upper torso/chest several times. The victim officer managed to fire one shot from his own weapon, but he did not hit his assailant. As the shooter attempted to flee the area, he quickly encountered another officer with whom he exchanged gunfire. The 35-year-old assisting officer, a veteran of law enforcement with over 10 years’ law enforcement experience, was shot in the hip.

A special agent with the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office was shot and killed at 6 a.m. on November 19 while attempting to serve an arrest warrant at a residence in Indiana Township. The 33-year-old agent, who had more than 6 years of law enforcement experience, was part of a multi-agency arrest team that had been investigating a man at the residence. Members of the team knocked on the home’s front door and rang the doorbell. The suspect approached the front door, was advised of the law enforcement’s presence, and notified that the officers had a warrant for his arrest. The man did not open the door; instead, he ran in the other direction. The arrest team initiated a forced entry using a battering ram to open the door and enter the house. While officers were using the ram, they repeated several times that they were police. After the ram successfully opened the door, the special agent was the first officer to enter the residence. As he entered, the individual’s wife fired a single round from a .38-caliber revolver. The round struck the agent in the front upper torso/chest above the bulletproof vest he was wearing. The agent was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.
