"On September 17 just after 1:50 p.m., a 27-year-old deputy sheriff working on behalf of the Rancho Cordova Police Department (RCPD) was killed and another deputy sheriff was wounded while answering a call for service. [RCPD police services are provided under contract by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD).] At 1:44 p.m., the SCSD communications center received a call from someone at an automotive parts store in Rancho Cordova regarding a disturbance involving a customer threatening store employees. Dispatch radioed the two deputies, who arrived on the scene simultaneously in separate patrol vehicles. Once inside the store, the deputies, who were both dressed in RCPD uniforms, attempted to speak to the suspect, but he ignored their questions and walked away from them. The deputies pursued him, but the suspect pulled a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from the front area of his clothing and pointed it at the deputies and a store employee. The suspect shot the employee once in the back, then began shooting at the deputies. The 27-year-old deputy, who had 4 years of law enforcement experience and was wearing body armor at the time of the incident, attempted to move to cover, but the suspect pursued him, shooting two rounds from close range into the deputy’s rear upper torso/back and in the rear of his head. Meanwhile, the other deputy, who was 28 years old and had more than 3 years of law enforcement experience, fired at the suspect as he ran outside the building. The deputy took cover, reloaded her handgun, and continued to scan the area for the suspect. The suspect re-entered the building through a service door, flanking the deputy. The suspect and the deputy, who was also wearing body armor, again exchanged gunfire, during which the deputy was wounded in the arms/hands. The suspect, who was wounded in the left leg, fled the store. Responding deputies encountered the suspect as he was running along the road, so they exited their patrol vehicle and ordered him to stop. He refused and continued running. The deputies got back into their patrol vehicle and continued the pursuit as the suspect ran into a nearby parking lot. When the deputies spotted him again, they saw that he was carrying a firearm. They stopped and exited the patrol vehicle, and the suspect began firing at them. The deputies returned gunfire, and the suspect sustained a wound to the back, falling to the ground. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to an area hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. While these events were transpiring, the 28-year-old deputy began rendering first aid to the severely injured 27-year-old deputy at the automotive parts store. Personnel from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department arrived and continued life-saving efforts, but the deputy succumbed to his head injury. The 28-year-old deputy was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her injuries and had not returned to duty at the time this report was submitted to the FBI. The 38-year-old suspect was on probation at the time of the incident and was known to law enforcement as being a user of a controlled substance with a history of violence and mental illness. He was charged with Murder, Attempted Murder, and Felon/Addict in Possession of a Firearm.

Evidence showed that an attacker had shot five rounds into the vehicle with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The victim lieutenant was in the front driver’s seat with bullet wounds to his chest, his arms/hands, and a fatal wound to the front of his head. He was pronounced dead a short time later. The next day, tips called in to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the CHPD’s tip line, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provided information to investigators about the alleged shooter and the murder weapon.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment. After a bit, the group decided to back out of the area and regroup. As the investigator descended the stairway and made his way into the corridor, he passed the front door of the apartment. At that time, a suspect inside fired through the door with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The investigator was struck three times: in the foot, in the thigh above the knee, and, fatally, in the rear left upper back through the armhole of his body armor.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the firefighters were ambushed by a concealed individual who was firing rounds from a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle. The lieutenant realized what was happening and shouted to the other firefighters advising shots were being fired. As firefighters were being wounded, the off-duty lieutenant, who had 19 years of law enforcement experience, exited the fire truck from the passenger side and, now acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer, traveled on foot in the direction of the shooter. During this advance, the veteran lieutenant was fatally shot in the front of the head.

"A park ranger with the Mount Rainier National Park Service (NPS) was shot and killed around 10:40 a.m. on January 1, while she was assisting another ranger who was making a traffic stop. Shortly before the incident, a man drove his vehicle past a checkpoint set up to ensure vehicles were four-wheel drives or equipped with chains due to the poor road and weather conditions in the park. The ranger who was operating the checkpoint planned to meet another ranger at a safe area to conduct a traffic stop. The ranger from the checkpoint followed the suspect’s vehicle while a 34-year-old ranger, who had 11 years of law enforcement experience, came from the opposite direction. The 34-year-old veteran ranger positioned her vehicle to block the roadway and turned on the emergency lights. After the two rangers had blocked in the man’s vehicle, the man exited his vehicle and began shooting a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle at them. The rangers backed up and attempted to move a safe distance from the line of fire, their vehicles bouncing off of the snow banks in the process. The ranger from the checkpoint radioed dispatch indicating “shots fired” and successfully escaped the scene. An NPS maintenance employee had parked about 400 feet above the traffic stop to divert oncoming traffic and witnessed the entire incident. He reported the other ranger’s vehicle slammed into a snow bank as she was maneuvering away after the shots had been fired. The employee went to her vehicle and found the ranger had been struck by the gunfire. Because the vehicle was still in gear and the doors would not open, he broke the passenger side window in order to check on her. One of the rounds fired had penetrated her body armor, wounding her in the front upper torso/chest. The victim park ranger received a fatal gunshot wound to the front of her head. The 24-year-old suspect fled on foot and was found dead in a creek within the park on January 2. The suspect’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.

The deputies were conveying two prisoners from court back to the county jail. During the transport, a male prisoner managed to unlock his handcuffs and leg shackles. When the transport van arrived at the jail, the deputies exited and moved to the back of the van. They opened the doors, and the 59-year-old deputy, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 39 years of experience, escorted the female prisoner toward the jail.

The suspect exited the van, approached the vehicle, pointed the firearm at the driver, and ordered her to get out of her car. The woman exited her vehicle and began to walk away; however, the suspect soon realized the vehicle had a manual transmission, which he could not drive. He ordered the woman back into the vehicle and forced her at gunpoint to drive to Omaha, Nebraska. Once they reached Omaha, the woman convinced the suspect to let her go. After exiting the vehicle, the woman called for help. The 24-year-old suspect was arrested in Omaha the same day and charged with First-Degree Murder, Voluntary Manslaughter, Attempted Murder, two counts of Robbery in the First and Second Degrees, and Escape from Custody.

When he attempted to take the male into custody, they became involved in a violent physical struggle during which both men apparently lost their weapons. Though the officer was able to handcuff one of the suspect’s arms, the suspect took the officer’s weapon, a .357- caliber semiautomatic handgun, and shot him twice at close range fatally in the back of the head. The victim officer died at the scene before backup officers found the trooper. The suspect fled the scene with the officer’s weapon and was arrested following a 2-day manhunt by state and federal authorities. The 29-year-old suspect—who was known to possess, use, and deal drugs—was charged with Murder First Degree and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance.",580
"A 39-year-old detective with the Riverdale Police Department was shot and killed on February 4 while handling a prisoner who was brought to the police department on charges of Home Invasion, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Attempted First-Degree Murder. At 8:15 p.m., the veteran detective with 12 years of law enforcement experience was moving the prisoner from an interview room to a lock-up area for processing. The man, who was not handcuffed at the time, managed to remove the detective’s service weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, from its holster. He led the detective outside and forced him behind a building where he shot him in the side of the head, killing him instantly. The 27- year-old suspect then attempted to carjack three separate cars but was unsuccessful, even though he shot at and wounded the driver of the first car. The drivers of the other two vehicles used their cars to knock him down as they sped away. Three Riverdale police officers arrived on the scene and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He responded by firing the weapon at the officers. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. He died at the scene.",369
"On September 13 around 5:40 p.m., a 34-year-old patrol officer with the Plymouth Township Police Department was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect who had previously been involved in an automobile accident. After crashing his vehicle, the driver abandoned it and fled on foot to a nearby bike trail. The officer, who had 5 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner, chased the suspect, who shot at them with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The veteran officer, who was wearing body armor, was fatally struck in the front of the head. The K-9 was wounded in the right hip. The 44-year-old suspect had a prior criminal record, which included weapons violations and police assault.

"A 31-year-old patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department, who had nearly 4½ years of law enforcement experience, was fatally shot at 2 a.m. on August 18 when he was dispatched to a scene where another officer had been wounded. The wounded officer, an 8-year law enforcement veteran, was investigating a disturbance call (shots fired) when he was shot in his lower abdomen and left thigh. Before the attack, the officer had arrived at a residence and interviewed the person reporting that a man was shooting a machine gun from behind a nearby dwelling. After the interview, the officer drove his patrol car closer to the residence, and the man began firing at him with a semiautomatic rifle. It was then that the officer notified the dispatcher that he had been shot and requested backup. An assisting officer drove to the wounded officer’s vehicle and removed him and a witness from the scene as the shooter continued peppering the area with shots. The wounded officer subsequently was transported to a local hospital for treatment. As the assailant continued his rampage, additional responding officers, including the 31-year-old patrol officer, took positions in the area. The patrol officer, who was crouched behind the opened passenger door of his cruiser, was shot in his chest before he was able to fire his service weapon. The bullet entered above his protective vest near his collarbone and traveled down his body causing severe internal injuries. Officers removed the mortally wounded officer from the scene and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him while they waited for medical assistance to arrive. The officer subsequently was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. In the meantime, a SWAT officer, who had 16 years of law enforcement experience, and several other units moved into position to locate the shooter, who had moved from his initial location behind the dwelling. The officers could not immediately determine the assailant’s position, but they knew he was nearby as the shots rang out in the darkness. As the SWAT officer opened the trunk of his vehicle to retrieve one of his weapons, the suspect shot him in his right knee. The assailant shot two patrol officers as well, striking one officer in his right bicep and the other in his left wrist. Other officers at the scene extricated the two injured patrol officers, who were transported to a local hospital for treatment. Although the SWAT officer was wounded, he took cover behind a telephone pole after he had located the position of the shooter. The suspect appeared from behind a vehicle parked in front of a residence, and the SWAT officer fired at him. The officer advanced toward the shooter staying on the opposite side of the parked vehicle for cover. As he approached the suspect, the officer emptied all 24 rounds of his SWAT-issued M-4 service rifle. Some of the rounds struck the man; however, he was still standing and attempting to aim his weapon at the officer. The officer was able to get close enough to strike the suspect in the head with the butt of the rifle. The blow knocked the suspect to the ground on his back; however, he rolled to his left and attempted to fire at the officer with a pistol he was also carrying. The SWAT officer fired his handgun, delivering a fatal shot to the assailant. Ultimately, the officer had struck the man eight times— three times in his chest, twice in his head, and three times in his legs. The shooter died at the scene. The SWAT officer was then transported to a local hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound. Investigating officers entered the initial residence from where the shooter had begun his assault and found the body of the suspect’s mother, who had been shot three times in the torso. Later investigation revealed that the 33-year-old shooter’s mental state had caused police to detain him a few months earlier. At the time he was detained, the confused man thought he had killed his mother and brother. During the man’s detention, the police discovered a cache of weapons the man had accumulated. At the request of the man’s mother and officers on the scene, the weapons were confiscated. The unstable man was hospitalized, treated, and subsequently released. Unfortunately, the officials had no legal grounds to retain the weapons, and they had returned them to the man a few weeks before the incident when the man and his brother had attempted to regain possession of them. Police had designated the shooter’s home a “hazard area”; however, his shooting spree began at his mother’s residence, which had not been flagged.",290

Around 3 a.m., the officer, who had nearly 9 years of experience, was traveling in his patrol vehicle when he observed a man riding a bicycle without lights and attempted to stop him. When the officer moved his vehicle to block the bicycle’s path, the man turned the bicycle into a driveway and began riding on the sidewalk. The subject rode around the front of the patrol vehicle and returned to the street. The veteran officer activated his overhead lights and followed behind him. From the patrol vehicle’s camera, the man was heard asking the officer, “What did I do, man?” as he stopped his bicycle. The officer exited his vehicle as the man approached the back of the passenger side of the vehicle. The officer ordered the man to get his hands out of his coat, but the man drew a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots at the officer. Then, as he walked around the back of the vehicle, he fired two more shots. The officer fell to the ground, but was able to return fire, striking the offender twice. The wounded offender ran from the scene and was found hiding a short distance away. The officer was wounded in the lower back, in his arm, and in his upper back.

"An officer with the Oceanside Police Department was shot and killed while making a traffic stop about 5 p.m. on June 13. The 27-year-old officer, with a little over a year of experience, approached a vehicle he had stopped in a parking lot and asked the driver for his license. The man replied that he did not have one, and he then apparently produced a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and fired three rounds at the victim officer, wounding him. The officer returned fire and shot the suspect in the leg. The man, who was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the incident, exited his car and continued to fire at the now prostrate officer. The suspect then pistol-whipped the officer and, taking the officer’s 9 mm semiautomatic service weapon, shot the officer with his own firearm.

The officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, had stopped a vehicle with three occupants. As the officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, one of the occupants shot the officer with a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the neck/throat above his body armor. A second officer pursued the vehicle as it sped from the scene. At one point in the subsequent chase, the suspects’ vehicle stopped at a rest area and one of the suspects carjacked a second vehicle, shooting the car’s owner in the process.

"A police officer with the Poughkeepsie Police Department was killed while attempting to make an arrest at 1:10 p.m. on February 18. The 44-year-old veteran officer, who had over 18 years of law enforcement experience, responded with other officers to a call about shots fired in the parking lot of a small business. Upon their arrival, officers encountered a male suspect armed with a small semiautomatic handgun. It appeared that the suspect was injured and that his weapon was not functional. However, the suspect fled on foot and officers pursued him. The officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon, but he refused. The officer then returned his own weapon to the holster and approached the offender in an effort to subdue him. During this contact, the suspect gained control of the officer’s .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fatally shot the officer once in the face. The suspect fired at another officer but missed. The 27-year-old suspect then shot himself in the head and died at the scene.

"On June 29, a deputy sheriff with the Berks County Sheriff’s Department was killed while on special assignment at 6:30 p.m. The 28-year-old deputy had 5 years of law enforcement experience and was part of a task force that was assembled to apprehend an individual at a home in Kempton. As task force members forced the individual from the home, he retreated to a wooded area behind the residence and scaled a steep hillside. The deputy, who was wearing body armor, and his K-9 pursued the subject and confronted him on top of the hill. The man fired two rounds from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle; one round struck the veteran deputy in the front below the waist and a second round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his body armor, fatally wounding him in the front upper torso/chest.

"At the same time, a second suspect jumped a fence behind another residence and landed within view of an officer, who ordered him to lie down. The suspect ignored the officer’s commands and continued running. One of the officers yelled, “Gun, gun, gun!” The CI officer, a veteran with 17 years of law enforcement experience, had just left the area where the first suspect was arrested and joined the pursuit for the second suspect. At 12:06 a.m., the second suspect ran through a small opening between the front of a parked truck and the corner of a house. An overhead floodlight lit the opening, but everything beyond the hood of the truck was in darkness. Once the CI officer, who was wearing body armor, reached the opening, the suspect fired three rounds at him with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The CI officer took cover and returned gunfire. One of the suspect’s rounds struck the CI officer in the front of his head, and he collapsed. Another officer returned gunfire, and the suspect fell to the ground. When the suspect began to stand up with the firearm in his hand, a third officer commanded him to stop moving, but the suspect did not comply. The two officers fired again, and the suspect fell with his firearm still in his hand. Both officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop his firearm, but he did not, so they held lethal cover on him in case he attempted to shoot at them again. Meanwhile, other officers carried the injured CI officer to the street, loaded him into a marked patrol vehicle, and transported him to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later that day. After officers secured the scene, an emergency medical technician evaluated the 23-year-old suspect and pronounced him deceased.

The officers on the scene located the final suspect in a nearby garage. The suspect complied with officers’ commands to crawl out of the garage, and they took him into custody.",721
"Around 11:40 a.m. on June 27, a 39-year-old sergeant with the Prince George’s County Police Department (PGCPD) was struck and killed in Laurel by a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect. The 10-year veteran of law enforcement, along with an assisting corporal with the PGCPD, had approached a suspicious vehicle that appeared to have stolen Virginia plates. The sergeant had parked his marked vehicle to prevent the driver of the suspicious truck from exiting the space in the apartment complex where it was parked. The sergeant exited his cruiser and walked toward the suspect vehicle. Suddenly, the driver accelerated the truck (later determined to be stolen from a local dealership) toward the sergeant. The sergeant discharged his service weapon six times, and four of the rounds struck the vehicle. The driver kept accelerating, struck the victim sergeant, and dragged him over 200 feet before fleeing the scene.

"A police officer with the New Bern Police Department was killed and an officer from the same department was injured during a foot pursuit that ensued after a traffic stop regarding a bicycle light violation. On March 28 around 11:50 p.m., the 22-year-old officer, who had 8 months of law enforcement experience, activated the lights on his patrol vehicle to stop a man who was riding a bicycle without lights. When the officer approached the bicycle’s rider, he noticed a strong odor of marijuana. The officer radioed for an additional officer to assist him. Three officers responded and arrived on the scene. The officer advised the assisting officers that he had stopped the man for not having a light, but he was concerned about drug violations because of the marijuana scent, which the other officers also detected. The officer informed the subject he intended to conduct a search. The subject objected to the search and became agitated but voluntarily gave his backpack to one of the assisting officers. After handing over the backpack, the subject quickly turned and ran from the officers. The officer and two of the responding officers pursued the subject. After running approximately a quarter of a mile, the subject turned and fired rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer, who was wearing body armor, in the side of his head. The victim officer had not drawn his weapon, and it was still in the holster as the other officers arrived and began CPR. A 23-year-old responding officer, who had more than a year of law enforcement experience and was also wearing body armor, continued to chase the suspect and commanded him to stop and drop his weapon. The suspect turned and fired two shots at the responding officer, striking the officer in the front below the waist (thigh area).

The veteran officer asked the driver to step out of the vehicle and face away from him. The driver initially complied, and the officer asked him to place his hands behind his back. Suddenly, the driver retrieved a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun from his right rear pants pocket and fired two rounds at the backup officer, who was wearing body armor. One of the rounds struck the backup officer in the front lower torso/abdomen; however, his body armor prevented the round from entering his body. The second round struck and damaged the backup officer’s holstered service weapon as he turned around to seek cover behind his patrol unit. The suspect turned and fired three rounds at the veteran officer. The rounds struck the officer in his arms/hands and fatally in the front upper torso/chest above his body armor. Then, the suspect continued to shoot at the backup officer, who returned fire with one round before his damaged service weapon became inoperable.

"Around 2 a.m. on September 20, a patrol officer with the Indianapolis Police Department was fatally wounded while responding to a domestic call. Moments earlier, the 41-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience, was the first officer to arrive at the apartment from which a neighbor in the complex had heard cries for help and had contacted the police. The officer knocked on the door, but no one immediately answered. Unknown to the officer, a man inside was holding his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint in the front room and had been doing so for the last 3 hours during which he had physically and sexually assaulted her. The woman’s baby was also in the apartment in a bedroom. Upon hearing the officer knock at the door, the suspect ordered the woman to the floor and looked out the peep hole in the door.

"A 33-year-old Baytown Police Department officer, a veteran with nearly 10 years of experience in law enforcement, was injured while responding to a robbery in progress shortly before 7:30 a.m. on April 11. As an employee at a check-cashing business was preparing to open the front door, a man approached, pointed a firearm at her, and ordered her to let him inside. As she opened the door, the employee pushed a portable panic button she was carrying. Once inside the business, the offender forced her to open interior doors, providing the employee an opportunity to enter a distress code into the alarm system. He restrained her with zip ties and told her to open the safe. When she hesitated, the offender sprayed her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. A second offender arrived at the door, and when the first offender had her open the door for him, she grabbed the keys to her vehicle, rushed outside, and tried to enter her vehicle as the two men attacked her.

"A deputy sheriff with the Storey County Sheriff’s Office was injured while handling a person with a mental illness on January 2 just before 4:30 p.m. in Virginia City Highlands. The 44-year-old deputy, who had more than 1 year of law enforcement experience, responded to a call of a suicidal subject with a knife. The deputy radioed for backup, parked his patrol unit, and approached the residence on foot because of heavy snow. As the deputy neared the residence, he heard an argument from within the house. When he knocked on the door of the residence and announced himself, the deputy heard a man inside the house making violent threats toward him. The deputy convinced the subject’s wife to exit the house; however, she came outside barefoot and, due to the deep snow, was forced to remain near the house. As he approached the wife, the deputy heard the sound of a bolt being racked in a rifle. Then, from within the house, the subject announced he was going to kill the deputy. Without further warning, the suspect fired 13 rounds at the deputy with a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle from a first-floor window. One round struck the deputy, who was wearing body armor, in the rear lower torso/back and knocked him to the ground; however, his protective vest prevented a potentially lethal injury. The suspect’s wife, who was standing near the deputy, was struck in the left leg by bullet fragments. The victim deputy regained his footing and fired six rounds from his service weapon into the window where the suspect had been shooting. The deputy then repositioned himself near the rear of the residence. Several minutes later, the suspect, wounded in his right arm and upper torso by flying glass, gave up and exited the house. As the deputy approached, the suspect once again became aggressive, and the deputy used his electronic control weapon twice to immobilize the suspect. The deputy handcuffed the suspect and took him into custody. The 51-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record including a drug law violation, was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. He was arrested and charged with Attempted Homicide, Battery with a Deadly Weapon Causing Injury, Unlawful Discharge of a Firearm, and Domestic Battery.

The suspect had sold methamphetamine to undercover agents on two previous occasions and was presumed to be armed. As agents attempted to breach the door of the residence where the suspect was located, the suspect opened fire from inside the building, shooting through the door and striking the investigator in the front lower torso/abdomen below his body armor. Another OBN agent was also injured. Other agents returned gunfire and justifiably killed the 43-year-old suspect, who had prior arrests including a weapons violation and other crime of violence. The investigator’s resulting spinal cord injury rendered him a paraplegic. His health continued to deteriorate, and he died from complications on August 4, 2018, at the age of 61.",130
"At 4:18 in the afternoon on May 9, a 44-year-old detective with the Battle Creek Police Department was shot and killed while investigating a homicide. The 19-year veteran of law enforcement, along with his partner, was following a lead regarding the murder of a taxicab driver. They were attempting to gain entrance to a second-floor apartment of a female whose name was found along with bloody clothes and a knife inside a gym bag that was located in a garbage bin near the scene of the homicide. When the two detectives did not get an answer at the door, the first detective stepped outside the front of the apartment building and attempted to peer through the window. When he failed to see anything, he returned to the front door of the apartment where the detectives heard movement inside the residence. The second detective stepped outside to the back of the building and observed a male on the screened balcony of the apartment. The second detective identified himself as the police and informed the man he wanted to speak with him. The man turned and went back into the apartment. The second detective was reentering the building when he heard shots. He went down the hallway and looked up the stairs to the apartment door’s landing. A man fired a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun at the second detective and wounded his ankle. The second detective returned fire, but the suspect escaped from the rear balcony of the residence.

"On July 17, a police officer with the Hawaii County Police Department was killed while answering a call for service in Mountain View. At 9:47 p.m., officers began communicating with each other via radio about a wanted suspect possibly parked alongside the highway. While responding to an unrelated call, one officer replied that he had seen a blue sedan parked in the same area with a single occupant in the driver’s seat. Four officers responded to the scene in separate vehicles. Three officers parked behind the suspect vehicle and walked to the rear of it but could not see inside because of the vehicle’s dark window tint. A fourth officer arrived and parked 10 feet in front of the suspect vehicle to illuminate it with his headlights. The officers could clearly see the empty passenger and back seats, but the driver’s seat and headrest were not visible. This led the officers to believe that the seat was fully reclined. One officer knocked on the trunk of the suspect vehicle and saw the driver’s seat pop up with a male sitting inside. Twice, the occupant opened the door about a foot, then closed it while ignoring the officers’ commands to exit the vehicle. Officers could see him moving inside the vehicle but could not tell what he was doing. The driver’s door opened a third time, and officers saw a single hand come up and out of the door. The driver said he was coming out of the vehicle. The 46-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, walked to the driver’s side door, and the suspect immediately fired five rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer in the front below his waist/groin area and fatally in his neck/throat. The other officers returned gunfire, but the suspect fled on foot. Despite a canvass of the area, the suspect remained at large. The victim officer, a veteran of law enforcement with nearly 10 years’ experience, died the next day. On July 18, a multijurisdictional task force issued a media release seeking information from the public and began searching for the suspect by contacting confidential sources and informants. Using telephone numbers obtained from confidential sources, investigators narrowed the search to a single phone line and tracked it to the southern point of Hawaii Island. On July 20, the Special Response Team began screening vehicles departing the area. At 2:45 a.m., the team checked a vehicle with a male driver and two female passengers. The officers thought the rear cargo compartment looked staged, with a blanket covering the back and groceries propped up in front of it. Two team members opened the rear hatch, patted the blanket, and noticed movement under it. Suddenly, two rounds were fired from under the blanket in the direction of the officers. One team member fell backward, and the other returned gunfire. Two other team members also returned gunfire. A female emerged from under the blanket with her arms raised, and the body of a male rolled out of the compartment, justifiably killed by the officers’ gunfire. The male was identified as the suspect who had killed the officer 3 days prior. The suspect was 33 years old and was on probation and conditional release pending criminal prosecution at the time of the incident. He was known to possess and use controlled substances, and his criminal history included incarceration and previous arrests for a drug law violation, a weapons violation, other crime of violence, and resisting arrest. Investigators suspect this was a suicide-by-cop incident. The wounded Special Response Team officer sustained a gunshot wound to his front upper torso/chest and has since been released from the hospital. ",143

Less than an hour later, the APD officer, a veteran of law enforcement with 5 years’ experience, saw the suspect’s vehicle traveling on a roadway that was less than a mile from the location of the robbery.  When the suspect turned his vehicle into a nearby parking lot, the officer followed and activated his emergency lights to initiate a traffic stop. Before approaching the vehicle, the officer observed that the driver was female and determined that the male passenger fit the description of the suspect; therefore, the officer approached the passenger side. The officer’s body camera and in-car dash camera footage showed the suspect refused to obey the officer’s commands to keep his hands in sight. The officer saw the suspect draw a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. The officer, who was wearing body armor, reached inside the vehicle through the window to control the armed offender, but the offender shot the officer in the side of his head.

The truck had left the gas station approximately 16 minutes before the trooper was killed at the traffic stop, which happened to be the driving time between the two locations. Further investigation indicated the driver was the actual shooter.

The officer, who had 2 years of law enforcement experience at the time, was sitting in his marked patrol vehicle when he noticed two men in a van pull into a hotel across the street. He ran the van’s license plate number and learned that the van was registered to a man who had three outstanding arrest warrants. The officer drove into the hotel’s parking lot and saw the van was now backed up to the door of a hotel room, and the two individuals were unloading items from the van into the room. The officer parked his vehicle, got out, and approached the driver. He asked the man if he was the owner of the van; the man said he was.

"In the early hours of August 1, a 48-year-old police officer with the DeKalb County Police Department sustained severe injuries while checking on the welfare of a citizen in Lithonia. On July 31 beginning at 11:50 p.m., DeKalb County Communications received three phone calls in quick succession from the same number in Lithonia. The operator received little information from the calls but was able to discern that a female caller was being threatened by someone in the residence. Four minutes later, three officers responded to the address. Finding no lights on, the officers knocked on the door but received no answer. The officers looked around the outside of the residence but saw nothing alarming. The officers requested the dispatcher phone the complainant. When no one answered the call, the officers left the scene. At 12:29 a.m., another female called from a different phone number and reported that a family member called and awakened her, saying that during an argument, the caller’s son had shot his girlfriend. The caller immediately hung up. Three officers (two of whom were at the residence earlier) were dispatched to the scene. The operator called the complainant back and confirmed that the complainant’s son had shot his girlfriend, and that he was shooting at the officers who had already arrived at the residence. Body camera footage shows that as the three officers approached the front door of the residence, they encountered rifle fire from the subject inside. The 48-year-old officer, who had almost 3 years of law enforcement experience, was struck by three rounds, sustaining injuries below his body armor in front below his waist/groin area, his rear lower torso/back, and his arms/hands. As the officers took cover, the wounded officer discharged seven rounds from his service weapon in the direction of the gunfire, and another officer fired one round. None of the rounds struck the offender. The third officer radioed dispatch and alerted them that shots had been fired and an officer was injured. One of the assisting officers administered first aid to the wounded officer and escorted him to an emergency medical services unit. From there, the officer was transported to a local hospital where he underwent surgery. Meanwhile, the DeKalb County SWAT Team, Bomb Unit, K-9 Unit, Traffic Aggressive Control Team, and Aerial Support Unit responded to the scene. The SWAT Team entered the residence and found a deceased female with a chest wound in a second-floor bedroom. After the scene was cleared, a K-9 team began tracking the offender, locating his cell phone and a white shirt in the yard next door to the incident location. K-9 teams continued tracking the offender into the night and the next day with no results. On August 8 at 10:30 p.m., the Fugitive Unit, in conjunction with the K-9 Unit and U.S. Marshals, performed a vehicle traffic stop at a gas station in Lithonia and arrested the offender, who was a passenger in the vehicle, without incident. The 27-year-old offender was charged with Second-Degree Murder, three counts of Aggravated Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer, Damage to Property, Possession of a Firearm or Knife/Cutting Instrument During a Crime, Probation Violation, and Battery/Family Violence. His criminal history included charges for aggravated assault, assault on a law enforcement officer, a drug law violation, and resisting arrest. At the time this incident was reported to the FBI, the injured officer had not returned to duty.",1157
"A 57-year-old detective with the Kingman Police Department was wounded during a tactical situation around 9:45 a.m. on September 29. The 17-year veteran of law enforcement was among a group of detectives serving a search warrant at the residence of a man who was being investigated regarding a stolen firearm. The detectives were confronted by the subject at the front door of his residence. He was armed with a .38-caliber revolver at his right side, and detectives ordered the man to drop his weapon. The man refused and replied several times, “Shoot me . . . just shoot me.” After about 30 seconds, the man raised his firearm in the direction of the detectives and fired four rounds. Two of the detectives returned fire, striking the 53-year-old suspect four times and killing him instantly. One of the detectives was shot at close range in the front upper torso/chest and also in the arms/hands.

"Around 11:45 a.m. on February 19, a 48-year-old police officer with the Bay City Department of Public Safety (BCDPS) was shot and wounded while assisting in a tactical situation. Earlier that morning, a BCDPS task force learned a subject had violated his conditional release bond the previous day. Around 10 a.m., three BCDPS officers in unmarked vehicles began physical surveillance of the suspect’s residence. At approximately 10:30 a.m., the suspect came outside the residence to greet a male visitor. The man and the suspect both entered the residence. Slightly more than an hour later, the officers saw the man and the suspect leave the residence. Both men got into their vehicles, the man drove away first, and seconds later the suspect followed. Both vehicles turned onto another street, where a uniformed BCDPS officer in a fully marked patrol unit was positioned to enact a traffic stop on the suspect. One of the plainclothes officers joined the uniformed officer at the side of the road, where the uniformed officer ordered the suspect to exit his vehicle. However, the suspect disregarded the order and sped away. The two officers ran back to the marked patrol unit, and a vehicle chase ensued. The officer in the passenger’s seat notified dispatch of the pursuit, as the suspect led the officers back to his residence. The suspect parked his vehicle in his driveway, jumped out, and ran toward a basement window on the north side of the house. The plainclothes officer exited the patrol unit and continued the chase on foot. When the suspect reached the basement window, he broke the glass and attempted to dive inside. However, he got stuck halfway through the opening with his right arm and right leg still outside the window. The officer grabbed the suspect’s arm and attempted to pull him back outside. During the struggle, the uniformed officer arrived to assist. When the suspect’s arm slipped from the plainclothes officer’s grasp, the suspect fell into the basement, and the officer stumbled backward. The uniformed officer covered the window and ordered the suspect to come out. The plainclothes officer then ran back to the patrol unit, which was parked in the driveway, to turn off the vehicle’s siren. As he was running, he heard a single gunshot coming from the basement. After turning off the siren and starting back toward the basement window, the officer heard several more gunshots coming from the west side of the residence. He took cover at the corner of the street and saw that the uniformed officer had taken cover behind the front wheel located on the driver’s side of the patrol unit. He then noticed another one of the plainclothes officers had arrived to assist and had been struck in the rear lower torso/back with a round from the suspect’s 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. The wounded police officer, a veteran of law enforcement with more than 22 years of experience, had taken cover behind the rear wheel located on the driver’s side of his unmarked vehicle. Both the uniformed officer and the wounded plainclothes officer were trapped behind their vehicles with no escape routes from the suspect who had barricaded himself inside the residence. At that time, four additional BCDPS officers arrived on the scene. The initial plainclothes officer obtained a department-issued AR-15 rifle from the arriving officers and positioned himself to cover the officers who were still unable to move from their locations. Officers from other local agencies and the Michigan State Police Emergency Support Team also responded to assist. The suspect committed suicide several hours later. The 38-year-old man, who was known by law enforcement to deal drugs, had a prior criminal record including charges for a police assault, weapons violation, and drug law violation. The victim officer was treated at a nearby hospital for his injury and has since returned to duty.",625
"On August 28 at 5:21 a.m., a 36-year-old police officer with the Baltimore County Police Department was fatally wounded during a tactical situation in Catonsville. The tactical unit was serving a no-knock search and seizure warrant, which authorized officers to enter the residence without first knocking and announcing their presence and intention. The veteran officer, with more than 13 years of law enforcement experience, and his partner were the first team to enter the residence of a suspect wanted for attempted murder. Once inside, the officers loudly announced, “Police search warrant.” The officer’s partner noticed a subject rolling from the living room couch and scurrying on his hands and knees toward the kitchen. The officer pursued the subject and was able to pin him down on the kitchen floor with his ballistic shield. While the officer was securing the fleeing subject, his partner noticed a second subject at the top of a stairway and asked to see her hands. The subject’s hands were empty, and the partner turned to enter the kitchen where he heard gunfire. A third subject, who was hidden in a utility room adjacent to the kitchen, had opened fire with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, striking the officer already in the kitchen three times in his protective vest and once, fatally, in the rear lower torso/back just below his body armor. Although he was mortally wounded, the victim officer was able to fire seven rounds with his service weapon in the direction of the offender.

The offender had prior arrests for Assault and Possession of a Controlled Substance with Intent to Distribute; he later died at an area hospital.",805
"A 26-year-old Locust Grove Police Department (LGDP) patrol officer with nearly 5 years of law enforcement experience was shot and killed and two deputy sheriffs with the Henry County Sheriff’s Office were injured while attempting to gain control of a suspect around 10:55 a.m. on February 9. The two deputies, ages 48 and 62, were at a residence attempting to execute an arrest warrant on a suspect who failed to appear on a city ordinance violation. The suspect refused to comply with the deputies’ requests, so they radioed for assistance to take him into custody. When the LGDP officer arrived at the scene, the three officers, who were all wearing body armor, attempted to take the suspect into custody; however, the suspect resisted and retreated into his residence. The officers followed the suspect into the residence, and the man took a blunt object and struck the 62-year-old deputy in the head. The suspect then took out a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and fired at all three officers. The patrol officer was shot in the neck/throat, front upper torso/chest, and fatally in the side of the head. The deputy who was struck with the blunt object had fallen to the floor, but he was able to return gunfire, striking and justifiably killing the 39-year-old suspect.

The 69-year-old chief, a 23-year veteran of law enforcement, was struck by a vehicle as he attempted to stop traffic and pedestrians from entering a roadway during a vehicle pursuit that began in a nearby county. Deputies from the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office, the Long County Sheriff’s Office, and the Georgia State Police were in pursuit of a vehicle that was headed toward Ludowici at speeds exceeding 100 mph. Deputies had deployed spike strips along the route, and despite the rear driver’s side tire being punctured, the vehicle continued to flee at speeds of 90 to 100 mph. The chief was attempting to clear traffic at the intersection as the vehicle approached. The driver of the vehicle targeted the chief, intentionally hitting him. The vehicle then left the roadway and fatally struck a motorcyclist at an adjacent gasoline station before it came to rest. The driver attempted to flee on foot but was quickly apprehended by state troopers. The chief was transported by ambulance to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The 23-year-old driver was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. He was transported to a hospital, where he was treated and released before being charged with Murder, First-Degree Homicide by Vehicle, Fleeing or Attempting to Elude Police for a Felony Offense, Driving Under the Influence, Speeding, Reckless Driving, Hit and Run Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury, Failure to Report an Accident with Injury or Damage, and Weaving Over the Roadway.

"A chief deputy with the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office died July 17 from wounds sustained during a shooting on June 21. At 10:15 a.m. on June 21, the 59-year-old chief deputy, who had nearly 29 years’ law enforcement experience, was on patrol looking for a pickup truck involved in a home invasion and a minivan that had been stolen from the home. On a road in Tuscola, the veteran chief deputy met vehicles traveling toward him that matched the descriptions. As the suspects’ vehicles passed his, three bullets were fired from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun into the chief deputy’s vehicle, one striking him in the face and another striking him fatally in the chest. Despite his wounds, he was able to radio his location, the last location where the vehicles had been seen, to law enforcement. Two suspects, one 23 years old and the other 24 years old, abandoned the pickup truck and fled in the stolen minivan. The chief deputy was transported to a hospital in Urbana where he remained until his death. Members of the Illinois State Police (ISP) located the suspects’ vehicle and a high-speed chase ensued. During the chase, shots were fired at the police. ISP officers pursued the suspects until they entered the town of Arcola, where the suspects crashed the minivan. The 23-year-old suspect was immediately apprehended, but the 24-year-old suspect ran into a bank and held five people hostage at gunpoint. Following hostage negotiations with which additional ISP personnel and the FBI assisted, the suspect released the hostages unharmed and then surrendered.

"A 46-year-old inspector with the Pittsburg Police Department was shot and killed on April 15 shortly after 11 a.m. while investigating a homicide. The 23-year law enforcement veteran was investigating a murder that had taken place the previous week. He had made arrangements with the owner of the house where the murder occurred to collect additional evidence from the scene. The owner did not live at the residence, so the inspector believed that the house was vacant. When the inspector entered the house, a man fired eight shots from a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun at him. The bullets struck the inspector in the chest, neck, and fatally in the front of the head. The man fled the scene. Investigators in the victim officer’s death identified a 40-year-old suspect, a man who had an extensive criminal record including Assault With a Deadly Weapon on a Police Officer. Law enforcement officers tracked the suspect to another county through interviews and surveillance of his relatives. On April 17, when officers attempted to arrest him, he shot at them. In an exchange of gunfire, an officer shot and killed the suspect. Investigators later determined that the offender was also responsible for the murder from the previous week.",429
"A 34-year-old police officer with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) was killed and two more CHP officers were wounded shortly after 5:30 p.m. on August 12, in Riverside. The first officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, was on a patrol motorcycle and stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation at 4:54 p.m. The officer determined that the driver of the vehicle was unlicensed; the officer then prepared to impound the vehicle. At 5:04 p.m., the second CHP officer, a 34-year-old with more than 4 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene to assist. Without warning, the driver, who was now standing outside his vehicle, reached into his vehicle, retrieved a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle, and began firing at the officers. Footage from the assisting officer’s in-car dash camera showed that the officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect as the assisting officer radioed for backup. At 5:37 p.m., the third CHP officer, a 33-year-old veteran with nearly 6 years of law enforcement experience, arrived at the scene along with a fourth CHP officer; they joined the first two officers in the shootout. A short time later, officers from the Riverside Police Department and the Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner's Department arrived to assist. During the prolonged encounter, the suspect fired 120 rounds at the officers, and the officers returned gunfire with a total of 123 rounds. Three of the officers’ rounds struck the suspect, justifiably killing him. He was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. Eight of the suspect’s rounds struck the officers during the exchange of gunfire. The first CHP officer, who was wearing body armor and a motorcycle helmet, sustained gunshot wounds to the arms/hands, the shoulder (upper torso) area when the round entered through the armhole or shoulder area of his vest, and a fatal wound to the side of his head. He was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased.

"Around 5:30 p.m. on March 24, a 21-year-old trooper with the Wisconsin State Patrol (WSP), Fond du Lac Post, was fatally shot while pursuing a suspect in an armed bank robbery and related homicide. In response to a broadcast that described the suspect and the vehicle he was driving, law enforcement positioned themselves at various locations in the region. At 5:33 p.m., the trooper radioed that he had seen the suspect’s vehicle and was following it from a distance without any emergency lights or siren activated. When the suspect drove his vehicle into a plaza with shops and restaurants, the trooper, who had more than 2 months of law enforcement experience, slowly followed in his squad car. As the vehicles neared the east side of the store, the suspect made a U-turn and shot the pursuing trooper through the driver’s side window of the squad car. The suspect exited his vehicle while it was still in drive and continued firing at the trooper, who exited his squad car—also still in drive—and returned fire. The two continued to exchange gunfire as they ran around the slowly moving squad car, and then the suspect ran toward an apartment building. During the exchange of gunfire, the suspect fired nine rounds from a 5.7x28 mm semiautomatic handgun, hitting the trooper at least once; the victim trooper returned fire, striking the offender with one round. The trooper’s squad car eventually stopped just northeast of the apartment building, and the suspect’s vehicle stopped near the corner of the store. The first assisting trooper to arrive witnessed the exchange and radioed “Shots fired!” to call for backup. She observed the victim trooper fall to the ground as he continued to shoot at the fleeing suspect. Moments later, another trooper arrived, called for additional backup from other local law enforcement, exited his patrol vehicle, and pulled the victim trooper behind the first responding trooper’s vehicle. The two administered first aid to the victim trooper. Although he was wearing body armor, the victim trooper sustained injuries to the front upper torso/chest, the rear upper torso/back (from a round that exceeded the vest’s specifications), the neck/throat, and his arms/hands. A captain with the WSP arrived and helped lift the trooper into a vehicle to transport him to a trauma center, but the victim trooper succumbed to his wound in the rear upper torso/back while en route to be airlifted. Meanwhile, law enforcement officers from the Fond du Lac Police Department and the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Department came to assist. These agencies provided armored response and rescue vehicles to cover officers on the scene and to approach the suspect, who was found lying south of the store near the apartment complex. Witnesses said they saw the suspect crawling from the area. Using the armored vehicle as cover, officers verified that the suspect was no longer a threat, removed the handguns near his body and in his possession, and then permitted paramedics to approach him. The 38-year-old male, who had a criminal record that included a violent crime, had been justifiably killed by rounds fired by the victim trooper.",640
"A 33-year-old Baytown Police Department officer, a veteran with nearly 10 years of experience in law enforcement, was injured while responding to a robbery in progress shortly before 7:30 a.m. on April 11. As an employee at a check-cashing business was preparing to open the front door, a man approached, pointed a firearm at her, and ordered her to let him inside. As she opened the door, the employee pushed a portable panic button she was carrying. Once inside the business, the offender forced her to open interior doors, providing the employee an opportunity to enter a distress code into the alarm system. He restrained her with zip ties and told her to open the safe. When she hesitated, the offender sprayed her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. A second offender arrived at the door, and when the first offender had her open the door for him, she grabbed the keys to her vehicle, rushed outside, and tried to enter her vehicle as the two men attacked her. The officer arrived on the scene, and the employee broke free from her attackers and ran toward the officer, who was exiting his patrol unit. The two offenders began firing their weapons, one of which was a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, with many of the 15 rounds striking the officer’s vehicle and shattering the window and windshield. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was injured on the front and side of his head by shards of glass. The officer and the employee moved to the rear of the patrol unit, and the officer returned fire. A round struck one of the offenders in the leg, and he fell to the ground.

The 9-year veteran of law enforcement was working with a violent fugitive task force with the U.S. Marshals Service. Earlier in the day, the task force had arrived at an apartment building with a search warrant and searched an apartment there. They found and seized weapons, but did not locate the suspects for whom they were looking, so the officers left the scene. After further investigation, it was determined that the suspects were actually in the apartment building but located in a different apartment than the one they had searched. The team reconvened and returned to the building. The team took positions, with the investigator taking a position in a stairway above the apartment, and contact was attempted with the residents of the apartment.

"On March 31, a 43-year-old patrol officer with the Johnson City Police Department was shot and killed with his service weapon while handling a person with a mental illness. Shortly after 7 a.m., a man called the emergency number and requested that officers come to a health services building. He explained to dispatchers he was concerned that terrorists may have attached a bomb to magnets in medical equipment housed in the facility. The man affirmatively stated to dispatchers that he believed people were going to die. Other people called dispatch after the man’s initial call and indicated there was a man “out of control,” with mental health issues at the health services location. The veteran officer, who had 18½ years of law enforcement experience, and another officer were dispatched to the health services business where the man who had called was preventing others from entering or leaving. The officers arrived in separate marked patrol vehicles.

Despite his injuries, the assailant rose to his knees and grabbed the officer’s leg and pulled the officer to the pavement. As the officer and the assailant struggled on the ground, the officer fired two more rounds, striking the assailant. He continued to fight and managed to get his finger on the trigger of the officer’s weapon, discharging a round and causing the firearm to malfunction.

They observed a vehicle with tinted windows in the driveway matching the description the father provided for the suspect’s vehicle. The officers, in marked police units, converged on the home to set up a perimeter. The suspect, who was sitting in the driver’s seat of the vehicle in the driveway, fired a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at the first officer to exit his vehicle. The victim officer, who was wearing body armor, was shot in the back of the head and in the rear below his waist. He immediately dropped to the ground. The other officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect until he ceased firing. The 20-year-old offender, who had no known criminal history, died at the scene. Two officers went to the aid of the victim officer. They placed him in a police vehicle and removed him from the area. The victim officer was then taken by ambulance to a local hospital where he died early the next day from the gunshot wound to the back of his head.",175
"During the early hours of April 9, a 38-year-old deputy sheriff with the Harvey County Sheriff’s Office was fatally shot in the face during a tactical situation in which hostage negotiations broke down. He was a veteran officer with nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience. In the same incident, a 33-year- old veteran police detective from the Hesston Police Department sustained multiple bullet wounds but survived; he had 8 years of law enforcement experience at the time of the assault. Both men were wearing body armor and were part of a multi-department emergency response team (ERT) that had been dispatched with a separate team of hostage negotiators as a result of a 911 emergency call. In the late evening of April 8, a young female called the Newton Police Department and indicated that her mother was engaged in a domestic disturbance with the mother’s boyfriend. The caller reported that the suspect was armed. Responding officers declared that it was a hostage situation, since the suspect was allegedly holding an adult female against her will inside the residence. The ERT members and hostage negotiators arrived and established a perimeter barricade. About 3:10 a.m. the negotiators spoke on the phone with the suspect and the victim. At that time, the suspect denied that he had any weapons and agreed to a face-to-face meeting with the negotiators at the door of the residence. The ERT members escorted two negotiators through the perimeter barricade. The suspect opened the front door of the residence but not the storm door. The negotiators asked him how they could help to resolve the situation. The suspect would not let the female go outside, but he did turn on the living room light, making it possible for the negotiators to see her standing in the room. She said something to the suspect that apparently angered him, and he slammed the door shut. Immediately after that, the negotiators and officers reportedly heard him hitting the female and her subsequent screams. Believing that the hostage was in imminent danger, the officers forced their way into the residence using a ballistic shield. As the ERT members entered the residence, the suspect immediately fired multiple rounds from a .45- caliber semiautomatic handgun. He mortally shot the deputy sheriff, who was the first ERT member to cross the threshold. The suspect then shot the detective, who received wounds to his hands, arm, and leg. Other ERT members returned gunfire and removed the wounded men from inside the house. The detective, who was wearing a SWAT uniform with police lettering, was taken to a local hospital and recovered from his wounds but has not returned to duty. The 46-year-old suspect surrendered around 8 a.m. His prior criminal record included violent crime and police assault. He was a known drug dealer and was under the influence of narcotics and alcohol at the time of the incident. He was charged with Capital Murder, Attempted Capital Murder (2 counts), Criminal Possession of a Firearm, and Aggravated Kidnapping.",728
"A 45-year-old corporal with the Detroit Police Department was wounded during a tactical situation on May 23. Around 7 a.m., police were called to a residence where shots had been fired. When officers arrived, emergency medical services were already on the scene, and personnel were tending to a female victim. A suspect had fired shots into a residence, and glass from a broken window caused a wound to the woman’s chest. Several members of the woman’s family told officers that the suspect fled to another residence where he was holding his wife and children hostage at gunpoint. The woman’s family members began to get into their cars to go to the suspect’s location. Fearing an active shooter incident, officers went to the residence where the suspect was reported to be and stopped the victim’s family members from entering. Officers saw a man lean through a broken front window of the residence and point a pump-action shotgun at them, advising them to back up. The officers cleared the area, and additional responding units set up a perimeter that included the area near the residence. They also established a command post in a nearby street. Several times, the man leaned out of the broken window or the front door, sometimes holding a handgun, before quickly going back into the residence. Then, a young female exited the front door carrying a small child, and officers guided them to the nearby command post. Approximately 30 minutes later, the front door opened again, and a young male who was carrying another small child exited the residence; they were also directed to the command post. Sometime later, a SWAT team arrived and took over the scene. At 10:29 a.m., the suspect exited the house, jumped off the porch, and fired two shots from a pump-action shotgun at officers. The corporal, a 15-year veteran of law enforcement who was wearing body armor, was wounded in the front of his head. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. Medic teams on site attended to the victim corporal and the suspect. The 25-year-old suspect was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead, justifiably killed by officers. The victim corporal has since returned to duty.",423
"A 30-year-old sergeant of the Omaha Police Department died on September 19 as a result of a bullet wound he received on September 11 at 9:55 p.m. during a foot pursuit of an individual who had run from a traffic stop. On the evening of the incident, two officers conducted a traffic stop, during which the lone occupant of the vehicle fled on foot. The officers initiated a foot pursuit and called for additional help. Responding to the officers’ call for assistance, the veteran sergeant, who had nearly 7 years’ law enforcement experience, and his patrol partner exited their cruiser within a block of the vacant vehicle and proceeded on foot toward it. Upon observing a man hiding in some bushes, the sergeant, who was wearing protective body armor, and his partner ordered the man to come out. However, the man fired a single shot from a .45- caliber semiautomatic handgun, hitting the sergeant in the front of the head. The alleged shooter, a known drug dealer with an extensive criminal record, then left the cover of the shrubbery. In an exchange of gunfire, the sergeant’s partner, who remained unharmed, wounded the suspect. Both the victim sergeant and the 21-year-old suspect were transported to an area medical center. The suspect died the next day, and the sergeant died 8 days after the incident.",280
"Shortly before 11:30 p.m. on February 20, a 27-year-old patrol officer with the Mobile Police Department was shot and killed while answering a call for service. The incident began at 9:30 p.m. after a call to investigate a deceased female lying in a roadway who appeared to have suffered blunt force trauma to the back of her head. While at the scene, officers interviewed two people familiar with the deceased individual. It was reported that she left her home earlier in the evening to pick up her ex-husband for choir practice. Later, her car was spotted in her ex-husband’s driveway. A detective on scene requested additional officers to accompany him to the ex-husband’s residence. The detective met the 27-year-old officer and a second officer at the precinct; the three of them arrived at the ex-husband’s home at 11:23 p.m. They saw the deceased female’s car in the driveway, so they took positions of cover. The detective and the 27-year-old officer, who had more than 2 years of law enforcement experience, went to the rear of the home; the other officer took cover behind a tree in the front yard. The detective spoke via cell phone to other detectives who were still at the original scene and decided not to attempt to contact anyone inside the residence. The 27-year-old officer returned to his marked patrol vehicle, which was parked down the street, to retrieve his department-issued rifle. He then joined the officer who was positioned behind the tree at the front of the house. The officers briefly spoke about contacting their superior officers, as they had been requested to do. The 27-year-old officer radioed dispatch. Just as he ended his radio transmission, an individual inside the home fired at the officer from a distance of 45 feet with a .38-caliber revolver. The officer, who was wearing body armor, was struck once in the front of the head. He immediately fell to the ground and was unable to take any action. The officer behind the tree fired twice, but both rounds struck the home. The uninjured officer notified dispatchers of the situation. The suspect continued to fire his weapon intermittently as responding officers extracted the victim officer from the scene. In all, the 72-year-old suspect fired eight rounds. The victim officer was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly before midnight. Officers held their positions until SWAT personnel arrived. Attempts to negotiate with the suspect began at 12:40 a.m., but no contact was made. At approximately 2 a.m., SWAT members inserted a reconnaissance robot into the home. The robot located the suspect, who had committed suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. The suspect had a criminal history that included a violent crime. ",182
"A 34-year-old deputy sheriff with the Boone County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) was killed while answering a call for service at 9:40 a.m. on March 2 in Lebanon. The incident began when Lebanon Police Department (LPD) officers attempted to serve a warrant, and three suspects fled in a vehicle. A pursuit involving the LPD and the BCSO ensued. At some point during the pursuit, a suspect exited the vehicle and began to flee on foot. The veteran deputy, who had more than 7 years of law enforcement experience, and his K-9 partner left their vehicle and chased after the fleeing suspect. As the deputy, who was wearing body armor, rounded the corner of a building, the suspect turned and fired three rounds from a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. One round struck the deputy in the front of the head. The suspect then ran between buildings and encountered responding officers, who fired seven rounds, one of which struck the suspect in the side. The victim deputy was taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on March 5. The 21-year-old suspect was also taken to the hospital and released on March 3. He was arrested and charged with Murder, Resisting Law Enforcement, Carrying a Handgun without a License, and Possession of Methamphetamine.

"Shortly before 4 p.m. on May 26, a Tucson police officer began investigating a hit-and-run incident. The evidence trail led him to a nearby apartment residence. Another officer arrived at that location approximately the same time, just as the suspect ran from the apartment. The first officer, a 40-year-old veteran with nearly 13 years of experience, took up a foot pursuit. The second officer drove ahead of the suspect’s flight path and stopped his vehicle in a position to intercept him. When he saw a man with a handgun in the front yard of a residence a short distance down the block, the second officer gave chase, caught the man, and placed him under arrest. Meanwhile, a local resident had called emergency services to report an officer down. Responding officers discovered the victim’s body lying in a yard near the point where the second officer intercepted the suspect. The victim officer had suffered two gunshot wounds from a .38-caliber revolver, one to his head and a fatal shot to his torso below his protective vest. The 33-year-old suspect, who was on conditional release pending criminal prosecution, was charged with First-Degree Murder.",1004
"A 32-year-old patrol officer with the Penn Hills Police Department was shot and killed on December 6 around 8:25 p.m. in an ambush. The patrol officer, who was a 5½-year veteran of law enforcement, was sitting in his police cruiser waiting for backup outside the house where a 911 call around 8:20 p.m. indicated that there was a man inside with a gun. While the telephone line remained open, the dispatcher heard what sounded like a struggle, then gunshots. A second officer arrived at the scene and reported that an officer was down. Additional units were called to the scene. Approximately 8:30 p.m., a sergeant arrived and found a woman standing in the street crying and yelling, “He’s been shot, the cop’s shot.” She told the sergeant that the victim officer was in his car. The sergeant told the woman to return to her house and remain there, and he ran to the patrol officer’s vehicle, where he found the victim patrol officer slumped in the front seat with a gunshot wound to his head. Because of the initial “officer down” call, medical personnel already had been dispatched. Within minutes of the sergeant’s arrival, an ambulance arrived at the scene and rushed the patrol officer to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later of the head wound from a round from a 7.62x39 mm semiautomatic rifle. Further investigation showed that the victim patrol officer, who was wearing body armor, was also shot in the chest but had been able to fire two shots from his service weapon before he was fatally wounded. They also found the body of another man in an upstairs bathroom. Apparently, the suspect had shot and killed the man in the bathroom and was attempting to run from the scene when he saw the patrol officer in the cruiser and had shot him. Twelve hours later, officers arrested a 32-year-old suspect when they located him in his mother’s residence. The suspect had a criminal record that included murder, weapons violations, and drugs, and was also on parole at the time of the incident. He was charged with two counts of Criminal Homicide, Burglary, Robbery, Illegal Possession of a Firearm, Possession of a Firearm without a License, Possession of a Firearm with an Altered Manufacturing Number, and Possession of a Prohibitive/Offensive Weapon.",301
"A deputy sheriff with the Richland County Sheriff’s Department survived being shot while responding to a disturbance call at 1:30 p.m. on February 26 in Columbia. The 45-year-old veteran deputy, who had more than 8 years of law enforcement experience, was patrolling in her marked vehicle when a woman with blood on her face flagged her down. The deputy pulled her vehicle into a nearby drugstore parking lot and then exited to speak with the woman. The woman reported she had been assaulted and described the male attacker. The deputy radioed for an ambulance and informed dispatchers of the situation. The deputy returned to her patrol vehicle and began searching for the suspect around a nearby gas station. While driving, the deputy noticed a suspicious-looking man standing between two parked buses. As the deputy stopped her vehicle, the subject, who fit the description of the assailant, came out from between the two buses and began to run toward the deputy. The deputy, who was approximately 6 feet from the subject, attempted to use an electronic control device on him, but the device malfunctioned. The subject began to run away and the deputy radioed that she was in a foot pursuit, and responding officers joined in the chase. At one point, the subject turned and fired a handgun at one of the pursuing officers, who responded by firing two rounds. Fearing for the other officer’s safety, the deputy fired three rounds from her service weapon, but the subject continued to flee. The pursuit led to an apartment complex where officers set up a perimeter. A K-9 was called in to track the subject. As the K-9 was tracking, a woman came around a corner of the complex and told officers the person they were looking for was in her apartment. The deputy radioed the information to dispatchers, and additional officers arrived at the scene. The subject then fled the apartment through the back door. As he was running, the subject began blindly shooting at the deputy with his right arm extended backward. The deputy immediately felt pain in her front upper torso/chest beneath her body armor. The victim deputy was able to fire 12 rounds at the suspect, killing him. The deputy checked herself for injuries and found a bruise underneath her body armor. She was taken by ambulance to a local hospital for treatment. She was released and has since returned to duty.

"Around 8:30 p.m. on August 30, a 28-year-old corporal with the West Columbia Police Department (WCPD) was wounded while answering a call for backup. A short time earlier, a WCPD officer responded to a report of an impaired man in a vehicle. The officer parked his patrol unit next to the man’s vehicle and approached the driver’s side door. The subject placed his vehicle in reverse, and the vehicle rolled backwards onto an adjacent street. The officer took hold of the side mirror and stopped the rolling vehicle. The subject was fidgeting and yelling, so the officer asked him what was wrong. The man ignored the officer and continued his erratic behavior. The officer asked the man to exit the vehicle, but the subject did not comply and stated he needed to make a phone call because he was out of gas. Tinted windows prevented the officer from seeing clearly inside the vehicle, so he called for backup. The corporal, who had nearly 4 years of law enforcement experience, and two additional WCPD officers arrived at the scene. When one of the newly arrived officers opened the driver’s door of the vehicle, the man grabbed a 4-inch knife and held it to his own throat. The man stated that he had been released from prison recently, and he was concerned the officers were going to take him back to jail. The subject repeated that he wanted to make a call, so one of the officers offered to make the call if the man would put down the knife. Once again, the subject ignored the officer and continued to rant and complain. A WCPD sergeant arrived at the scene and asked the man what was wrong; he replied that the officers were trying to take him back to jail. During their conversation, the subject placed the knife on the vehicle seat. While distracting the man by talking to him, the sergeant passed his electronic control device behind his back to one of the other officers. At that point, the sergeant and two of the officers reached inside the vehicle and attempted to pull the man out. The subject pulled away, regained the knife, and started swinging it at the officers as he shouted, “Shoot me!” During the scuffle, the corporal, who was wearing body armor, sustained a cut on his left arm/hand near his palm. The suspect closed the vehicle door, so one of the officers used a baton to break the window. The sergeant ordered the suspect to drop the knife; the suspect tossed it out of the window onto the ground. The sergeant then ordered the suspect to exit the vehicle with his hands visible and to get on the ground. Again, the suspect complied. The officers detained the suspect without further incident and took him into custody. The 40-year-old suspect, who was on probation at the time of the incident, had prior arrests that included a weapons violation and a violent crime. He was arrested and charged with Public Disorderly Conduct, Unlawful Weapon, and Assault on a Police Officer While Resisting Arrest. The corporal has since recovered from his injury and returned to duty.",646
"An agent with the Police of Puerto Rico, Humacao, was killed and a sergeant with the same agency was wounded while performing an investigative activity shortly before 8 p.m. on March 10. The 35-year-old agent and 51-year-old sergeant were dressed in civilian clothing and conducting surveillance of farm land reportedly being used for the illegal sale of vehicles and animals. Their initial drive-by prompted the officers to request backup officers. As the agent and the sergeant arrived at the farm in their unmarked vehicle, a sport utility vehicle (SUV) passed them and pulled alongside the road. A man exited the SUV and began to smoke a cigarette. When the agent exited his vehicle and walked toward him, the man started to run away. The officers advised him to stop, but the subject fled at full speed. Four additional subjects with weapons exited the SUV and fired at both officers; the sergeant returned fire.

"On July 27, at 2:40 p.m., a 38-year-old lieutenant with the Southport Police Department was killed while responding to a vehicle crash with entrapment. A major with the Homecroft Police Department (HPD) arrived first and saw a car on its roof. He parked his patrol vehicle along the curb of the northbound lane. The lieutenant arrived shortly after and parked behind him. The major spoke to a witness who reported she was driving her vehicle northbound when the other vehicle came toward her at a high rate of speed, went airborne, flipped upside down, and landed. The major approached the driver’s side of the inverted vehicle and saw the driver suspended from his seat belt. He then checked on the passenger who was sitting in the grass outside of the vehicle. The lieutenant, a veteran with 20 years of law enforcement experience, approached the passenger’s side of the vehicle, stuck his head inside, and advised the driver not to move. The driver became agitated and started cursing; the lieutenant told him to stay calm and help was on the way. The driver then used a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shot several rounds at the lieutenant. The HPD police chief and an off-duty reserve deputy from the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office, who had arrived at the scene, returned fire, injuring the driver. After the gunfire ceased, the veteran lieutenant was on the ground. He had been wounded in the rear legs, rear upper torso/back, front lower torso/abdomen, arms/hands, front legs/feet, and fatally in the front upper torso/chest. The rounds entered his body armor between the side panels, armhole/shoulder area, and above the vest. A handgun with the slide locked back was found lying on the ceiling of the overturned car. Officers commanded the driver not to move and extracted him from the vehicle. A nurse who witnessed the accident ran to the lieutenant and began performing CPR before he was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The 28-year-old offender, who received gunshot wounds to the right cheek, right clavicle, and left arm, was transported to the hospital. The offender was under the influence of marijuana, cocaine, and other narcotics at the time of the incident. He also had a criminal record that included a drug law violation.

"A 30-year-old agent with the U.S. Border Patrol in El Paso died on May 24 from wounds he suffered 4 days earlier. In the early morning hours of May 20, the agent, who was a veteran of law enforcement with more than 8 years’ experience, was off duty and spending time with his friends at a tavern. As they exited for the evening and made their way to their vehicles, they saw a man pacing in the parking lot and arguing with someone via cell phone. The man noticed the group looking at him, and he yelled and cursed at them for staring. He abruptly ended his phone call and accosted the group. The confrontation escalated, and the man produced a knife. The agent showed his badge and tried to calm the suspect down. The suspect slapped the badge out of the agent’s hand and thrust the knife at him, slashing the agent’s leg and his chin. The agent’s friends came to his aid while the offender turned and ran. The agent quickly got up and pursued the offender. The offender suddenly turned and, with a backhanded forearm motion, stabbed the fast-approaching agent in the left eye/front of his head. The agent dropped to the ground. Witnesses captured the offender a block away. Around 2:30 a.m., Pebble Hills Regional Command officers were dispatched to the address of the stabbing.

"A 49-year-old police officer with the Salt Lake City Police Department (Salt Lake City PD) survived injuries sustained while conducting an investigative activity on July 5 at 12:30 a.m. The injured officer was a veteran with 5 years of law enforcement experience. Earlier in the evening, a woman attended a fireworks display in a local park. While at the park, she realized that her cell phone was missing and probably stolen. She tracked the cell phone using GPS technology and drove to an address that was the likely location of her cell phone. The woman called police to report the stolen phone and to provide information regarding its probable location. A Salt Lake City PD officer met with the woman and her companion near the address of the residence where she suspected her phone to be. The officer and the woman agreed that she and her companion would stay in their vehicle parked away from the residence while the officer went to investigate. The officer would return and inform her of the status of her cell phone. The officer who spoke with the victim met the veteran officer at the residence indicated by the cell phone’s GPS signal. Upon arriving, the officers noted a party taking place, so they stood on the sidewalk and began a conversation with the individuals standing just inside the yard, which was surrounded by a short fence. When one of the officers asked to speak with the homeowner, a man came forward claiming he owned the residence. The officers explained they were investigating a possible cell phone theft. They told the homeowner that the phone’s GPS tracked the device to his residence. The homeowner denied knowledge of a stolen phone, said he needed to speak with his friends, and began speaking in a language the officers could not understand. To gain more information, one officer asked the homeowner and surrounding individuals if anyone had been at the local park for fireworks earlier; no one answered. The officer then asked the homeowner for his name and identification. The man refused to give his name or to provide his identification and told the officers twice to wait while he spoke with the other individuals present. After the officer insisted the subject provide identification, the homeowner said the officer “was on his property,” and he “knew his rights.” During the verbal confrontation with the homeowner, a 16-year-old male pulled out a cell phone, flashed its light in the officers’ direction, and said he was recording the incident. He and several other individuals instructed the homeowner not to cooperate. As the crowd became more agitated, one of the officers radioed for backup; however, his ear bud had been knocked loose, and he could not hear the dispatcher’s response. He then requested that the homeowner move away from the crowd, outside the fence, so they could speak in the driveway. As the homeowner walked out to meet the officers, several subjects followed. Officers directed the people to stand at a distance, but at least two subjects used cell phones to record video within an arm’s length of the officers’ faces, temporarily blinding them with the phones’ lights. One officer spoke with the homeowner while the veteran officer attempted to separate the angry and visibly intoxicated crowd that surrounded the officers on three sides. Because the 16-year-old male continued to be disorderly and ignore the officers’ orders to back up and stop shining the light directly in their faces, one officer tried to separate him from the crowd. The male was impeding the investigation, and the officer attempted to place the male in handcuffs but was unable to keep control of the subject’s arms. During the struggle, the officer noticed the homeowner, who was being vocal and appeared to be intoxicated, advancing on him from behind. The officer turned and blocked the homeowner, who fell backwards into the street. As the officer turned to check the position of the veteran officer, he saw the veteran officer was involved in a physical altercation with several men and women. He also witnessed the 16-year-old male make physical contact with the veteran officer from behind. Unbeknownst to the officer at the time, the 16-year-old male had removed the veteran officer’s folding pocket knife from his front pocket and stabbed the veteran officer in his rear lower torso/back, below his body armor. The officer ran to the victim veteran officer’s aid and attempted to knock the 16-year-old male suspect off balance, but the suspect locked his arms around the assisting officer, and they both fell to the ground. The suspect began to kick and punch the assisting officer. After a brief struggle, the suspect ran into the crowd. At that time, an additional officer and two detectives arrived to help regain control of the crowd. However, several of the subjects involved, including the 16-year-old male suspect, were headed toward the entry of the residence. Concerned the subjects were going to retrieve weapons, the officer pursued them and ordered the 16-year-old suspect to stop. When the suspect began to run, the officer grabbed his shirt as the suspect entered the screen door, pulling the officer inside. There, the suspect and two other men began to punch the officer and tried to push him out of the house. The backup officers entered the home to assist. During the struggle, officers used electronic control devices on two subjects to subdue and handcuff them. Meanwhile, medical personnel were summoned for the victim officer who sustained a stab wound from the knife that remained lodged in his rear lower torso/back below his body armor. The victim officer was admitted to a local hospital for his injuries. Once the scene was secure, an officer located a cell phone in the possession of the 16-year-old suspect that matched the description of the stolen phone. Further investigation revealed the phone belonged to the woman who reported it stolen. A 46-year-old suspect, who had a prior criminal record and conviction, was arrested and charged with Riot, Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, and Interference with Arresting Officer. The 16-year-old male was arrested and charged with Disarming a Law Enforcement Officer, Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, and Fleeing. The suspect had a prior criminal record including police assault, weapons violations, and drug violations, and he had been convicted previously. Both suspects were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. In addition, several other subjects from the scene were also taken into custody. The wounded veteran officer has since returned to duty.",1106
"On February 25 at 12:04 p.m., a 30-year-old police officer with the Pittsburg Police Department (PPD) suffered minor injuries while attempting to restrain an offender. The officer, who had nearly 3 years of law enforcement experience, along with two members of the Crisis Negotiation Team and others, responded to a call for service involving domestic violence between a father and a son at the father’s residence. The caller reported that the son was using a knife with a 4-inch blade to stab and slash into the metal screen security door and the exterior of the residence. Dashboard and body camera footage show that officers encountered the suspect about a block away from the residence, still armed with the knife. Officers repeatedly ordered the subject to drop the knife, but he did not comply. An officer deployed a less-lethal round, striking the subject in his abdomen to no effect, possibly because the subject was wearing a bulky jacket and was under the influence of amphetamine/methamphetamine. After again ordering the suspect to drop the knife, a second officer deployed an electronic control weapon, striking the subject in his temple and his chest to no effect. The subject continued to ignore commands to drop the knife, so the first officer fired another less-lethal round, striking the subject in the chest. At the same time, a third officer deployed her electronic control weapon, striking the subject in the chest, but these tactics were also not effective. A fourth officer deployed his K-9, who bit the subject’s left forearm. The subject tried to stab the K-9, so the 30-year-old PPD officer tackled the offender. During the ensuing physical altercation, the offender stabbed the 30-year-old PPD officer above his body armor, striking his left shoulder (upper torso) area. Another officer disarmed the offender and assisting officers handcuffed him and placed him in a restraint device because of his continued combative behavior.

Get out!” A private citizen, who had a permit to carry a concealed weapon, followed behind the male assailant and attempted to engage him in the store. However, the female shot and killed the private citizen. The offenders met at the ammunition counter, where the man smashed the glass and loaded ammunition into the woman’s duffle bag. The woman then walked to the northwest corner of the store with the man several steps behind. Several police units arrived at the restaurant in response to the officer shootings. Witnesses told one of the officers that the assailants headed toward the retail store, and the officer ran to the rear of the store. Witnesses outside the store told him there was a man inside firing a weapon. The officer entered through a rear door of the store and moved toward the northwest corner of the building. He spotted the man carrying a duffle bag and a firearm. The officer went down the aisle parallel to that of the male offender with the intent of engaging him at the furthest west aisle of the store.

A sergeant and four officers entered the store from the back door. Two officers established positions to the east of the suspects, and they were met with gunfire. They returned fire as the other two officers moved south then west of the suspects, which established the officers in the tactical “L” position. The suspects fired several times at these two officers, who were unable to return fire. The sergeant maintained a central location between the two teams of officers and tried to make contact with the offenders. However, the man yelled to the officers, “Stand down, I am in charge now.” The 31-year-old male appeared briefly in an open position, and two of the officers fired at him. The man fell to the ground. It appeared that he tried to talk to his 22-year-old female counterpart, and she pointed her handgun at him several times. Then, she pointed the weapon at herself and shot herself in the head. The man, who had a prior criminal record that included a violent crime and drug violations, died at the scene. The woman, who had no known criminal history, was taken to a local hospital where she died a short time later.",1053

"On May 5 at 12:35 p.m., a 37-year-old sergeant with the Cottonwood Heights Police Department, a law enforcement veteran with 6 years’ experience, sustained an injury to his arm while responding to a report of a suicide attempt. When the sergeant arrived at the residence, the subject’s sister reported the subject had taken approximately15 antidepressant pills and had been texting his friends indicating he wanted to kill himself. She forwarded those messages to the sergeant. Another female in the residence led the sergeant upstairs to the subject’s bedroom. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, knocked on the door and called out the subject’s name, but no one answered. The woman opened the door and gave the sergeant permission to enter the bedroom. Since the subject, who outweighed the sergeant by around 70 pounds, was under the influence of antidepressant pills and appeared to be in a hopeless frame of mind, the sergeant decided to wait for backup officers to arrive before engaging him. The subject told the sergeant that he wanted to kill himself because of “all the bad going on around him.” The sergeant tried to convince the subject to leave the bedroom, but the subject refused and said that he would not cooperate with medical personnel. Based upon the statements the subject had made to his sister and friends, the sergeant determined that the subject was a threat to himself and decided to have him involuntarily committed to a hospital. Once backup arrived, the sergeant pulled slightly on the subject’s legs, saying “Let’s go,” as the subject lay on his bed. Simultaneously, a backup officer tried to pull the subject up by his arm. At this point, the subject sat up quickly and stabbed the sergeant in the right inner forearm with a pair of scissors. The sergeant pulled the subject off the bed and onto the floor, and the backup officer positioned himself on the subject’s back in an effort to subdue him; however, the subject refused to relinquish the scissors. The sergeant deployed an electronic control device into the subject’s upper right thigh and again in the subject’s right side. The subject dropped the scissors, and the backup officer handcuffed him. Medical personnel evaluated the subject and transported him to a local medical center. Medical personnel also evaluated and treated the sergeant’s wound at the scene; the sergeant later sought additional treatment at an emergency care facility.

"A 30-year-old deputy sheriff with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department was killed on March 28 at 5:45 a.m. in Long Beach. The veteran deputy, who had nearly 7 years of law enforcement experience, was found lying next to her car shortly after nearby witnesses reported hearing gunshots. The deputy, who was on her way to work after leaving a friend’s house, was shot twice with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun.

"A police officer with the Clayton County Police Department died on December 18 after attempting an arrest around 2:45 p.m. the previous day at a motel in Stockbridge. The 24-year-old officer, who had less than 1 year of law enforcement experience, was the second officer to arrive at the motel on a disturbance call. The first officer on the scene spoke to a motel employee who explained that a couple continued to occupy a room two days past the scheduled check-out day, and the female occupant had become irate when asked to vacate the premises. The employee also reported the furniture in the room appeared to be damaged. When the second officer arrived on the scene, the officers made contact with the couple. The first officer asked to look inside the room to verify the furniture was damaged. The couple (who denied causing furniture damage) agreed but reported there were three pit bulls in the room. At the first officer’s request, they secured their pit bulls. The woman went inside the motel room with the first officer, and the man stayed outside with the second officer. After surveying the damage to the motel room, the officer emerged and indicated the couple should be placed under arrest. The first officer then walked behind the man and attempted to handcuff him. The man began to pull away, and the second officer grabbed the man’s left arm to try to pull the arm behind his back so he could be handcuffed. The man tried to grab the first officer’s electronic control device (ECD), but the officer took it and ordered the man to the ground. The man did not comply with the officer’s order, so the officer deployed the ECD. The man cried out and began running away.

"On May 5 at 12:35 p.m., a 37-year-old sergeant with the Cottonwood Heights Police Department, a law enforcement veteran with 6 years’ experience, sustained an injury to his arm while responding to a report of a suicide attempt. When the sergeant arrived at the residence, the subject’s sister reported the subject had taken approximately15 antidepressant pills and had been texting his friends indicating he wanted to kill himself. She forwarded those messages to the sergeant. Another female in the residence led the sergeant upstairs to the subject’s bedroom. The sergeant, who was wearing body armor, knocked on the door and called out the subject’s name, but no one answered. The woman opened the door and gave the sergeant permission to enter the bedroom. Since the subject, who outweighed the sergeant by around 70 pounds, was under the influence of antidepressant pills and appeared to be in a hopeless frame of mind, the sergeant decided to wait for backup officers to arrive before engaging him. The subject told the sergeant that he wanted to kill himself because of “all the bad going on around him.” The sergeant tried to convince the subject to leave the bedroom, but the subject refused and said that he would not cooperate with medical personnel. Based upon the statements the subject had made to his sister and friends, the sergeant determined that the subject was a threat to himself and decided to have him involuntarily committed to a hospital. Once backup arrived, the sergeant pulled slightly on the subject’s legs, saying “Let’s go,” as the subject lay on his bed. Simultaneously, a backup officer tried to pull the subject up by his arm. At this point, the subject sat up quickly and stabbed the sergeant in the right inner forearm with a pair of scissors. The sergeant pulled the subject off the bed and onto the floor, and the backup officer positioned himself on the subject’s back in an effort to subdue him; however, the subject refused to relinquish the scissors. The sergeant deployed an electronic control device into the subject’s upper right thigh and again in the subject’s right side. The subject dropped the scissors, and the backup officer handcuffed him. Medical personnel evaluated the subject and transported him to a local medical center. Medical personnel also evaluated and treated the sergeant’s wound at the scene; the sergeant later sought additional treatment at an emergency care facility.

"A 35-year-old police officer with the New York Police Department was shot at 2:50 a.m. on November 28 while attempting to make a traffic stop in Brooklyn. The 5-year veteran officer and his partner were on patrol in an unmarked police car when they saw the driver of a car run a red light.

They traced the man to his girlfriend’s apartment, where he eventually surrendered to the officers. They found the weapon used in the murder of the officer in the courtyard behind the girlfriend’s apartment building, where the alleged shooter had apparently thrown it.

"A trooper with the Michigan State Police (MSP), Oak Park Post, survived an assault with a firearm around 3:20 a.m. on February 11 while responding to a robbery in progress in Detroit. Throughout the night, two individuals allegedly had been posing as police officers and had committed a string of armed robberies and carjackings. They had also allegedly shot some of their victims. Recent radio communication conveyed that two troopers had spotted a vehicle matching the description of one of the carjacked vehicles, and the occupants matched the descriptions of the armed suspects. Upon seeing the troopers, the suspects abruptly pulled over and fled on foot. In response, at least 13 MSP troopers, an MSP K-9, and several Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers established a three-block perimeter in tLhawe EnnefoigrchembeonrthOoffoicder.sMKiSllePd aannddADssPauDlteud nits coordinated effoUrt.sS.toD erpeasrttrmicetntt roafffJiucs,ticcaen—vFaesdesratlreBuertesauinofpInavierssti,gaatniodn clear vacant buildings in groups of four. After the K-9 lost the track in a vacant lot, an abandoned house nearby was determined to be a likely hideaway. Four troopers and the K-9 entered the structure and cleared the ground floor. However, when they began to clear the second level, two of the troopers came under fire. One of the troopers, a 13-year veteran of law enforcement who was wearing body armor, saw a flash from a bedroom facing the stairwell and then realized that he had been hit in the lower left leg. Both the 37-year-old victim trooper and his partner returned fire, took cover, and then established verbal contact with each other. The second trooper yelled for the subject to show his hands and drop his weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, but the subject did not comply. Upon hearing the exchange of gunfire and radio communications, MSP troopers and DPD officers who were at area perimeter points tightened the perimeter to the outside of the residence. One trooper with an M-4 rifle and two DPD officers entered and provided cover at the top of the stairwell for the wounded trooper and his partner. However, as the injured trooper and his partner moved toward the stairwell, a shot came from the bedroom where the subject was hiding. The troopers and officers returned fire, but the wounded trooper and his partner were forced to retreat back to the room. Covering officers continued to announce their presence and demand that the subject surrender. Meanwhile, officers outside observed a second subject climb out of an upstairs window and jump from a lower roof onto the ground; MSP troopers and DPD officers immediately took him into custody. Inside, law enforcement heard a weak voice come from the bedroom where the subject was hiding. When troopers again demanded his surrender, two gloved hands appeared, but the subject’s full body was not visible. The trooper and officers on the stairs entered the room under the cover of the trooper with the M-4 rifle and, after a brief struggle, secured the subject. Led by his partner, the victim trooper limped down the stairs, and then was carried by his partner to an emergency medical services unit that transported him to a local hospital. At the abandoned house, the 38-year-old subject from the upstairs and the 36-year-old subject who had been apprehended outside, both of whom had prior convictions for violent crime and weapons violations, were arrested and charged with Armed Robbery, Carjacking, Assault with Intent to Murder, Felon in Possession of a Firearm, and Weapon Felony Firearm.

The officer approached the subject’s vehicle and asked him to open the window; the subject rolled the window down about an inch. The officer noticed a half-full mug of steaming coffee in the passenger seat. When the officer asked why the subject had stolen the coffee, he replied, “Because I can.” The subject admitted he had been asked to leave the property earlier the same morning. When the officer informed the subject he was trespassing, he replied with phrases such as “just shoot me then,” “suicide by cop,” and “pull the trigger.” The subject rolled up the window and turned up the volume of the radio. The officer asked the subject to exit the vehicle several times, but he refused. Two officers arrived to assist, and the original responding officer advised them of the situation and requested help to arrest the subject. The 51-year-old veteran officer, who had nearly 17 years of law enforcement experience, told the subject that he was under arrest and ordered him to exit his vehicle several times, but the subject did not comply. The officers observed the subject pretending to shave his beard with a knife and then actually cutting his neck. Because the subject was a danger to himself, the 51-year-old officer, who was wearing body armor, broke the front passenger side window, opened the door, and entered through it. The second assisting officer got into the car through the same door and unsuccessfully attempted to unlock the driver’s side door. Meanwhile, the 51-year-old officer wrestled the subject for the knife and repeatedly ordered him to drop the weapon. The original responding officer went to the passenger side and fired his electronic control device, which struck the offender in the upper right shoulder but had little effect. The second assisting officer unlocked the driver’s side door, so the original responding officer went back to that side of the vehicle, removed the subject from the car, and placed him in handcuffs. The subject had three 2-inch cuts on his left hand and abrasions on the right side of his neck, so the officers requested medical transport for him. During the struggle, the 51-year-old officer suffered a 1-inch cut on his left thumb. He was transported to a local hospital where he received six stitches and was released. The injured officer has since returned to duty. The 45-year-old offender was charged with Trespassing, Shoplifting, Obstruct/Resist Executive Officer, and Resisting Arrest. He had a criminal history that resulted in him being incarcerated in a penal institution.",463
