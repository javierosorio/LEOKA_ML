# Codebook

To conduct the annotations, this project relied on [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/), a web-based annotation interface. The PI expreses its gratitude for the Label Studio team to extend a free academic license for this project.

To conduct the annotations, the research project counted on the support of 36 undergraduate students grouped into 11 teams. 

This section presents the codebook used to annotate the LEOKA narratives. Please see file "LEOKA_codebook_1.2pdf"
